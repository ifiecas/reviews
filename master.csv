Update #2: I‚Äôm reading reviews saying it‚Äôs quiet... download the app and max out the EQ for low, mids & highs. It doubles the sound output. It doesn‚Äôt even distort the sound. It‚Äôs loud enough for me with regular settings though.1 month update: I‚Äôve had time to really enjoy this speaker. I want to talk about the battery life now. I wake up every morning at 4am to get ready for work. That‚Äôs when I unplug this speaker and turn it on. I play it softly in the morning. Until 4:50 when I set off for work. When I get to work my phone instantly returns to the xb43 the second I turn the key off. That‚Äôs where it starts playing 10 hours straight. Anywhere from 60% - 90% volume. I leave work and it‚Äôs at 70% battery still. After 10 straight hours! I don‚Äôt know how long it lasts on 100% volume with the lights on. It‚Äôs too loud. Our PM‚Äôs and President probably would ban all music if we were to blast it all day long.Now let me get back to the bass. The trick with the bass is to download the music center app and adjust the mids & highs to negative six to ten (-6 to -10) and adjust the lows to plus one or two (+1 or +2) that way the bass isn‚Äôt muddied and all you have to do is turn the speaker up louder to get massive op bass. Or put bass on 10 and the other on -10 to just slap xD(Old review): I‚Äôm not sure where to start with this thing. First of all the sound is on point. It sounds better than my cars speakers. The highs and mids are replicated beautifully.Now let me warn you about the bass. I don‚Äôt see anything extra about it. The bass is there. It creates the tones. It can replicate the bass from Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs ‚ÄúSwimming Pools.‚Äù Most portable speakers can‚Äôt even attempt to reproduce that low level of hertz bass line. It slaps but it‚Äôs a 7ish pound speaker so don‚Äôt expect to feel it in open spaces.If you listen in a confined space like the bathroom, the bass rocks. If your listening outdoors you can hear it. People will be impressed that this level of sound is coming from this sleek flashing bar. It‚Äôs very beautiful. It‚Äôs impressive. All my coworkers put away their speakers (Bose, JBL etc...) and downloaded the fiesta app and add songs to the queue. They like the sound of my speaker better than their equivalently priced bt speakers.

Speaker..s that I Really Like!!! Sony SRS-XB43,LBP,5,"With the Sony SRS-XB43 I finally have the sound I have been searching for. My old $35.00 Anker bluetooth, which I loved and had for seven years, was nothing special but a great value of sound vs $ finally died after a pool accident. I tried an off brand under $100, not good enough and returned it. I have gotten kind of picky about my sound and this category of speakers has drastically improved in the last 5 years so I decided to up my $$. I'm listening way more than I used to since we are staying home more now days. I bought a Bose Portable Home Speaker for a huge price increase! It's a really nice spacial sound and interesting features but it suits better to inside use. It's splash rating is ipx4 and doesn't cut it for how it gets used so I returned that one.Enter the Sony SRS-XB43, I read reviews all over the internet about this one and it seemed like one I'd like to try. Amazon and Sony then cut the price by $50 so I bought 2!!! They came the next day. This is no lie ....3 minutes after opening the box I was listening to music via bluetooth! While it's not as spacial as the Bose, it is more directional,more sound out the front than the back, this speaker is exactly the sound profile I like while listening. It can be a little punchy if you like and has great clarity and range of lows, mids and highs and balances those well so they don't override each other. I listen to everything blues, jazz, rock, acoustic, electronic, classical, big band, podcasts, old radio shows, ballgames..... everything and it performs near perfect for me. It's bigger than most and at 3+ pounds it feels like a ton. Carting 2 of these around will take getting used to but the sound is worth it. The lights don't interest me and they are easily turned off with the sony app.Pros : Great well balanced sound, waterproof, ridiculously easy bluetooth pairing, holds charge well , charges via usb- C and they seem solid, well-built and durable.Cons: Only one is the size and weight but it shouldn't be a deal killer.Darn near perfectThanks Sony and Amazon","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2020",AF3KIXJNMR2E3CCXWJAWKBQWTIFA,TRUE,10,Color: BluePattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

After reading reviews of cheaper brands which have poor ratings for battery quality and shelf life, when this very sturdy option went on sale, I figured it was worth the purchase.It has delivered so many times over. First, it provides very loud sound. I‚Äôve used it at several pool parties and it carries through the yard with no issue. It comes with an app to balance out the levels of bass. The battery life is actually much longer than 24 hours in my experience, especially when used indoors. I don‚Äôt use the light functions, and so it only requires charging every couple of months when I use it an hour a day.But the proof of is quality is how sturdy it is. Not once, not twice, but on three occasions, it has fallen on the concrete deck and the marble floor in the bathroom, and never once has it stopped performing. It sounds the same right out of the box, no rattling parts inside, nothing. I‚Äôm usually very mindful of my things, so I‚Äôve been nearly heartbroken each time it fell, but it looks and sounds brand new still.Buy this immediately and trust Sony to deliver quality. Note, it is a little bit heavier than most portable speakers, but that just means its solidly build.","Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2023",AEMTDARIFN25TJZCOORPNWE7K5YQ,TRUE,3,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

The Sony just doesn't reach the near-audiophile quality that the Harmon Kardon system is able to. The Harmon Kardon SoundSticks II is a completely wired system and lacks any Bluetooth connectivity and needs to be plugged in all the time. At 14 years old, it still sounds great.As for this Sony SRS-XB43, I have found creative uses for it. I use it mainly to provide audio to my iPhone when either streaming talk radio/podcasts or listening to music. It works wonderfully with the iPhone though Bluetooth connectivity. Let me clarify that the sound of the Sony SRS-XB43 is not bad, it just doesn't compare to the Harmon Kardon SoundSticks II system, which I have connected to my MacBook Pro. The Sony SRS-XB43 also connects to my MacBook Pro through Bluetooth just fine. But in terms of audio quality, the old Harmon Kardon SoundSticks II won out.The portability, waterproof design, and Bluetooth capabilities of the Sony SRS-XB43 are superb, so it compensates in that I can use it in a variety of ways.

I work somewhere that i am locked up in a car for my whole shift and we don't have access to the audio system of the car as the software on the cars has been heavily modified and that audio system is used for system prompts and such. We are allowed to use Bluetooth speakers though.I have heard some who have speakers that can get louder than this one, but not without very apparent distortion. Most people seem to be of the mindset that louder = better and I am here to tell you that is objectively false. I was first looking at the JBL brand as they came highly recommended only to find out they are almost all MONO now. Like they literally made their whole line up worse!!! You may be someone who says that it shouldn't matter since these speakers aren't separated much anyway. Well, I am here to say this is false, it makes a HUGE difference. This SONY offering has surprisingly wide stereo separation and clean clear delineation between sides. I was actually quite blown away by this.Yes this speaker is kinda big and pretty heavy. If I had known I may not have ordered this model just for portability reasons, but I will tell you here that I don't regret my purchase one bit!The app, well, I can take it or leave it. It doesn't really do anything for you over that what you can do on the speaker itself but it is a convenient way to change settings where the button for it is behind the charging door and a little out of the way to get to. You also do get equalization. If you are like me, I prefer a flat frequency response so I don't use it but it is a nice to have when say, a podcast isn't very well mixed.If I HAD to come up with a cons list for this guy it would probably be that it could use a bigger battery. You can use the speaker as a battery bank which is sweet but not really useful with the run time you get out of a full charge. This having been said it is still longer than most of the very large BT speakers in the same class out there. You can also give it way better longevity by not using the bass boosting mode. Audio books and podcasts also use way less power overall.Anyways, just buy it. Yes it isn't cheap but you won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2022",AFNNXYJTNPV3HEHQGQC6LDHK36EQ,TRUE,29,Color: BluePattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

Its Bluetooth connectivity can allow up to two (and possibly more) devices to be connected to it - I do this using my cellphone and laptop. It looks small, it does has some weight to it but in a good way. It does not wobble when it's seated on a flat surface - it can be seated vertically (but I won't advice this since the heavy bass could tip it off when placed in a vertical position). It's portable and can serve well for a small-sized indoor party with family and friends. Can save energy but turning off the bass. The app is very intuitive and easy to use - can adjust the equalizer, perform updates, see the battery life remaining and more. I haven't tested it in a wet environment, but like any of my electronic gadgets, I don't plan to use this speakers next to any wet surface. However, if a wet environment is a concerns for you, then just know this is safely good for use in wet environments (like next to a pool or in a humid bathroom). Great speaker, awesome battery life, nice clean sound - both treble and bass. It isn't a $1000 plus home theater speaker, but it definitely slaps hard for your listening pleasure.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2021",AGYODFZQBGOCBABZO4LB53HSCGPA,TRUE,2,Color: BluePattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

The XB43: the line-in option was a major reason that I chose this expensive (NOT overpriced!) XB43 speaker... I know that a lot of the price is for that ONE 4 letter word: *Sony*! ...but some of our pricey toys/ tools are needed for the quality, durability & performance that WE NEED!I like the simple but precise build. I have not completely ""dunked"" it underwater as described but I did get it covered with lake sand, greasy picnic fingers, puppy dog licks 'n gnawing attempts so I took a soft scrub brush, mild soap + warm soapy shower water to clean, it cleaned up nicely and STILL works as new.I use the line in with my Sony Walkman; the walkman's sound shaping modes will not work over the Bluetooth connections, as with earbuds, In Ear Monitors (I.E.M.) or headphones... but I do use the Bluetooth connectivity as well.Good line-of-sight connections, I'd like it to have Bluetooth 5 but as is ='s great quality.I have absolutely ZERO use for the distractive ""light-show"", annoying & useless.It weighs... (Oh Wait, let me tell you of a pet peeve of mine; *When SOME folks overuse the word TON!* !!!) +/- quite a bit so it's not really grab-'n-go portable & definately NOT back package but if you pack it into our lake/ beach-shore/ picnic/ power outage gear box -- all is good.That allmighty bass response is here...

Man, I wasn't disappointed. It has some good sound quality, great bass (even my friends complimented the bass for a portable speaker), and some amazing battery life. Plus... the lighting effects are very cool. I saw the built in party mode and stereo speaker options also (had no clue when I first bought it).Well, decided to bite the bullet and get one more. Not disappointed.... at ALL. I have both set up in stereo speaker mode. And together, they really do make it feel stereo - better than some normal speakers I have had. When in this mode, all the lighting effects sync up and do the same actions together (just in case you care about that type of thing). The battery life is pretty great... though I have noticed when using the extra functions it does drain a tad faster (don't worry, you are going to still have plenty of hours available even before you worry about needing a charge). The speakers also have the ability to allow you to plug something in and charge off of them, functioning like a portable battery pack (or an extra USB outlet if you are charging at the time).My only con I have noticed is the extra bass is almost TOO extra at times you want to play the music soft. Sometimes it can sound like a car rattling from bass when quiet. But it's usually on on songs that go way overboard on the bass (think EDM and such). Most of the time everything is perfect - and not enough downfall to affect my rating of the product.If you are on the fence about Sony speakers... don't be.

Love the fact you can put it on it's side or horizontally. Love using LDAC which provides better clarity of vocals during bassy parts of songs. And the LDAC support really helps bring Tidals Hi Fi quality to a speaker i can bring to family gatherings or listen to on the weekends when my sound system may seem a little too loud and overwhelming or just want to have the game sound coming out my sound system and the music in my background. If you want to get the best of it i suggest downloading the app for it and putting up the sliders to the max and maybe bringing down the mid and treble a little beneath the max bass if you want more bass emphasis without losing the mids and highs as much. I wish there was more sub bass sound out of this speaker (deeper bass) . It certainly gets loud enough for my liking, for medium to small living rooms but never have tried outside or in bigger spaces so haven't needed to go above 60% volume. It sounds pretty clear and has good bass especially on it's side but don't expect this speaker to give you the bass of a subwoofer and make your eardrums vibrate.

I have purchased several of the highest rated Bluetooth speakers on Amazon including the Bose 700 sound bar (what a disappointment) the upgraded Echo ""ball"" (terrible voice recognition) and several Anchor USB speakers (tinny sounding) . This was by far the best sounding. The base is tight without booming and the mid range response is very good. The high end is not too sharp or annoying like some speakers. I can really hear words and music clearly on this speaker and the base is very good. I could tell this was a good speaker as soon as I opened the box.. very heavy- which to me usually means not a cheap piece of plastic. Another reason why i like it is it doesn't auto power off when you are not using the Alexa Echo so its always ready. I keep mine plugged in and it sits on the half wall between my kitchen and my living room. It's very unobtrusive and is not too noticeable. Im going to purchase another one and pair them so I can have stereo sound. If you are looking for a good speaker, this is it. Mine was on sale for $145 which makes it a very good price for a good speaker.. My advise: Don't waste your time and money on the other cheap USB speakers. go for the ""gold"" standard SONY. BTW, the party light feature can be turned off.. nice for use old guys...","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2020",AHZM5AKX5UO7KGJCBJOO5YGOLENA,TRUE,2,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

You have to adjust the sound individually for each speaker. I'm giving them two stars because of all of the time I've had to spend trying to troubleshoot this to no avail.The problem here is that you have to use the phone app to change sound settings on the speakers. There is no corresponding computer app so no way to do that from the computer when the computer is connected to the speakers via Bluetooth. But as soon as you use your phone to connect via Bluetooth to change the sound settings, it drops the Bluetooth connection from the computer! GAAAAH! So you go buy audio cables and splitters so you can split the left and right audio out from the computer to the corresponding left and right speakers so you don't have to use Bluetooth audio. So now you can connect to the speakers with Bluetooth to change audio settings... but only one speaker at a time, never both at the same time, not to mention the fact that you've lost the convenience of them being Bluetooth speakers in the first place!Now, you might think if you use the phone app to group the speakers into a stereo pair then you can adjust the settings for both speakers at once, right? Nope. Doing that completely cuts off the audio jacks from the computer and switches the audio input to Bluetooth from the phone.The developers have confused and entangled two completely different concepts of control input vs audio input. If these were Bluetooth only speakers and there was a computer app that you could use to adjust settings, then that would be fine. But they are not. They are Bluetooth and audio jack speakers so there should be some way to use these speakers as a stereo pair via the audio jacks and adjust the sound settings for both speakers at once. In every way it feels like these speakers started out as Bluetooth speakers and then at the last minute someone through some audio jacks on them without bothering to actually modify the software support that in any intelligible and reasonable manner. It's pretty obvious that nobody on the Q/A team actually tried to use these speakers as computer speakers because these problems would have been immediately apparent. Or if they did and they reported these glaring defects, then some product owners or business managers must have decided to not spend the time and money to correct these issues.You might think I'm being overly harsh since there is a work around of just adjusting the sound individually, but that is a real pain because when you have two speakers, in the Sony software they both have the exact same name, so it is impossible to tell which one is which! And besides, why should I have to do that anyway? I paid close to $500 for this pair of speakers. At that price range I expect the associated software to be of commensurate quality and this software is simply not there yet. It does not deserve to bear the Sony name in its current state. But in the end, the longer this issue remains unfixed (it's been several months now and I've kept the software updated) my impression of the Sony brand is rapidly deteriorating anyway.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021",AFVUQYINL4K7JYZDS7D7RJ5NH4LA,TRUE,4,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

I bought these speakers (I bought 2 of them) because of the Sony name brand. It has always been a good brand for sound. The sound quality is ok, its not the best or the worst. I am sure you can get a higher definition in a BOSE or SONOS but the price point is the lowest for the XB43. Hence, my review of this speaker. I bought these speakers in an Amazon Epic Deal, which cut the price to $148.00 from the regular price of $248.00. In my opinion the speakers are really good at $148.00 but you can find better at $248.00. Why the four stars if I bought them at $148.00? because you can turn them OFF from your phone (Sony music APP) but not ON. When you have one, it is not a problem, but when you set them as a pair (which you can and it is the reason of buying two of these) you have to go to both speakers to physically turn them ON, which is not cool since I have them set up in different rooms. If you can turn them OFF, why not also turn them ON.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2020",AGE47EYFJDDYKZ4Z2OUJO5HWMUEA,TRUE,4,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

The Extreme 2 is comparable in price to this speaker, I own the E2, like it don't love it, and was torn between getting a second Extreme 2 to use 2 at once, or the Sony. The Sony has newer Bluetooth, lights, adjustable EQ, USB-C charging, etc. Can't ignore that value proposition. But the main reason I got the Sony is sound was supposedly better. It is. Voices and non-guttural music are noticeably clearer than on JBL right out of box. This includes classical music, Enya, and voices on TV shows. JBLs are certainly better for loud rap, but I'll take the modest hit in loudness for superior and more balanced sound and the far better feature set--especially ability to tweak sound via EQ.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2022",AH3E73KTKJSIHRLMDDX4KKYI7OXA,TRUE,5,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

More importantly, an article stated that so far only Sony Bluetooth speakers could produce stereo when you connected them together, not other brands. I bought JBL speakers, but I returned because they didn't produce stereo sound like Sony speakers do.Note: In order to have stereo sound, you'll need to connect TWO speakers of the same model together. I have two XB23 and this one XB43. Two XB23 speakers produce stereo, but when I ungrouped them to pair one XB23 with the XB43, they didn't pair as stereo but party mode, the (new) set didn't produce stereo sound. Three of them could group for party, but I want one XB23 to bring to office because the XB43 is too big and heavy to carry to the office everyday.

The portability is flawwed in that it is very heavy for it's size (which is just good quality actually) but has no handle. I solved this by buying a custom case with a handle for it so that is not a big deal, and it allows me to carry cables and stuff in the case. I can carry it around easily with the case and it is not as heavy or bulky feeling with the good handle. It would have been nice to have it incorporated somehow, but actually an external case is a better solution, leaving the speaker itself to be designed JUST for SOUND.

I'm glad I did because the sound quality over cheaper speakers makes it worth it.Size-wise, the XB43 is pretty big compared to what I've owned before. It's a bit over a foot long, and is pretty heavy. I guess that's what it takes to produce good sound though.The XB43 connects to my laptop or phone quickly upon powering on. So far I've used my speaker for over 10 hours, and the speaker says I have about 50% battery remaining. If you want to preserve the battery, you can leave it plugged into an outlet. Sound-wise, it's a massive upgrade over $100 speakers. It has solid bass (but don't expect subwoofer deepness) and it balances the highs and lows well. I've cranked it up while playing some modern pop, and there's no distortion. It can definitely get pretty loud for its size.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020",AG2DGQMT6RCINTRJSXTPV2VQCZCA,TRUE,82,Color: BlackPattern: SRS-XB43 Speaker

You can cycle through the different light display modes, including turning the lights off. Change the bluetooth connection protocol, very cool. Balance the audio, with the traditional sliders or one of a few presets.I was surprised to find out that you can connect two devices to it at the same time, for instance two phones can connect to it at the same time (possibly more, I don't know). However, only one device can be playing audio through it at once, for example if you are playing a song on your phone and the other device begins playing a song it will pause your application and play theirs instead.Long battery life.

I have the old XB40 Sony BT speaker and it sounds a bit heavier on the bass end.It just has a more well balanced sound overall and i love it! This speaker is just a tad bit better on the highs and tremble. But sound wise its nothing exciting to me. It's not terrible but could sound a lot better.

Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,TRUE,25,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

I could‚Äôve went with Champagne as well and would‚Äôve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,TRUE,8,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility.

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were ‚ÄúHow is this going to sound?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill this live up to its price?‚Äù & ‚ÄúHow good is the build quality?‚Äù. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the ‚ÄúStatement Red‚Äù as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,FALSE,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,FALSE,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability.

It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,FALSE,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,FALSE,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you.

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

So I bought two of these speakers on a whim during Black Friday having never bought a wonderboom product before, and I can say now that it was 100% worth it. I really like the big volume buttons so it's not a tiny surface when you're pressing down, I also really like that they are water resistant so I don't have to worry about changing the volume while washing dishes or hanging it out of the spray when showering. I've also spilled the glass of water on the same surface and there has been no problems. The hoop is stretchy but I like to have a carabiner on it to make attaching it to other things simple and to have a primary speaker I easily identifiable. Having a primary speaker is important for pairing, your primary will be the speaker that has a connection through your phone, so if you only want to grab one speaker having the primary easily identifiable is nice so you don't have to go through repairing things, which isn't necessarily hard but it's much simpler this way.The sound quality isn't astounding but it's good and despite being small it can get pretty loud, I've yet to use them at full volume. I'm really happy with how long the charge lasts, I don't find myself recharging them very often though I use them daily, and when I do it only takes a few hours. Ultimately very happy with these speakers!","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AEJPPR5H7GRCHR4VDOF4WCBDO7NA,TRUE,17,Color: Hyper PinkStyle: Wonderboom 3

And discover all the new stuff and podcasts with my Amazon Music subscription. The appearance is nice too. Not sure why gray was so much more expensive than the black or blue, but it fits into my apartment style. Lots of good reviews out there. This is one more. Recommend this Bluetooth portable speaker for ease of set up, good sound and for being as advertised. Hoping I continue to have a good experience.

Similar to how cuss words are omitted in some videos online, the audio cuts out for a fraction of a second, but just long enough to miss the word being spoken/sung at that moment. I don't think I can return this but if I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have gotten it. I have a UE Boom 2 from 2017 that was dropped off the fourth floor balcony of an apartment complex that still works perfectly and I reverted to using that, even though the size and shape are less convenient for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AFUZNRVK6OOJ4KCG5QXV7XD3WZ3A,TRUE,0,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3

The difference between WB2 and WB1 is quite smaller unless you do get two WB2s to pair them. I though it wasn‚Äôt possible, but I make instrumentals and WB3 has a more punchy bass with richer/clearer mids and highs. If WB2 was a 9, WB3 is def a 10. The outdoor mode does louden them, but only so much(it is perfect for keeping the music). The distance when they are paired before they start to distort can be fairly large but not large distances.When it comes to ordering two of them for pairing, if you want full surround sound speakers, these are not meant for you. Imagine high end tv speakers but you can place them wherever you want while being able to carry them in your hands with ease, that‚Äôs what WB3&2 are. However, if you want speakers that live up to their name, look no further. The prices are haunting, but you won‚Äôt be disappointed. If you have WB2s, I would suggest waiting a while for the WB3 prices drop as they are already a wonderful pair. On the other hand, if you have the money to spend, go ahead and but 2 of them for the stereo as you eventually will, and you will be amazed and won‚Äôt be able to listen to single speakers ever again.Downsides > fairly long time to charge, recommend charging over night.WB3 are a bit better at this but > will die within 3-6 hours if you are playing loud music that uses a lot of bass or has a lot of things happening. (Playing at max volume but like a movie or podcast doesn‚Äôt cause this)There is a little catch of the speaker gets hot > it will drain the battery faster and will get to low battery(the white light will turn red) quicker. If the speakers are too hot, they will shut off, and I mean hot to the touch. Just let them cool off completely and the Battery will return back to normal. However, sometimes you can power them back on right after, when they are completely dead, the red light will flash, so at that point you have to charge them.Again, they are expensive, you won‚Äôt be disappointed, but at the same time you‚Äôll be heavily missing out if you don‚Äôt have two of them(WB3 or WB2) for the stereo sound.I hope this review helps, please ask any questions you may have.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2022",AG7UCVX3UWZDD7TICTJNQU4ZVROQ,TRUE,49,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3

I liked that they were small, so I could move them around easily, but that they provide outsize sound given the small form factor. Key feature for me was the ability to to pair them together.The latter part was more difficult than I anticipated. I would connect one speaker, turn on the other, which would then 'steal' the music from the first. Pushed the button on the top of both speakers at the same time, as the instructions imply. This does not work, and actually disconnects both speakers from the input device (I'm using an iPhone to play Spotify, for what it's worth) and pauses the music. No way to reconnect without turning the speakers off and then on again, which gets you back to square one. I called tech support and even they couldn't figure it out, though they did share a video which gave me the 'clue' I needed to make it work. Here's the secret:1. Once you've paired both speakers, turn them on; one will connect to the source, one won't, as noted above.2. Then push the middle button on the top on the speaker that is NOT playing music, until it makes the beep-boop-beep sounds.3. Release that button, THEN press the speaker on the other speaker until it beeps and boops.4. Music will pause, but after a few more seconds of beeps and boops you'll be reconnected and can restart the music and both speakers will play nice together.Having figured this out I'm quite happy with the purchase- 5 stars if it wasn't such a hassle and the instructions weren't so inadequate. Lots of references to the app, which isn't even compatible with the Wonderboom 3. In general the instructions and support materials leave a lot to be desired. But it's a nice product once you figure out the 'trick' and get it working.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2023",AGEGHJ6EAWWOL4HVFWWG7STP744Q,TRUE,103,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3

Pricing $80-100 for a name brand speaker, newer generation released in 2023, is a bad joke.

I have seen all kinds of praise for the wonderboom 2 and once I saw that the wonderboom 3 was newly released I wanted to finally see what all the hype was about. Every early review I could find stated that the 3 had better bass and overall sound than the 2. If that is the case then the 2 must be a really bad speaker. Sure this speaker sounds pretty good but for anyone saying this has bass I'm struggling to hear where that bass is...The smaller tribit micro 2 I have, has more bass than this and in fact every single speaker I have pictured has better bass, not just mid bass which most speakers emphasize, but sub bass extention is better on all of them. I have the tribit stormbox the stormbox micro 2, soundcore flare 2, earfun uboom, jbl flip 6 and I would take any of these over the wonderboom 3. Out of all of them I would say I like the new flip 6 the best which the only downfall it has is the lack of 360 sound openness the other speakers have.One of the biggest issues, is this speaker was just released and they chose to not include usb-c charging and instead stuck with micro usb!? The only other speaker I have with micro usb is the original stormbox which was released a while ago so it gets a pass. There is no excuse for the lack of usb-c on a newly released small speaker in this price range.Then lets talk about how they have an eq adjustment in the app for the old boom and megaboom 3s but no eq at all for this brand new speaker. With some eq adjustment this speaker could potentially be a a lot better as the sound it puts out is not bad it just has no bass. It projects loudness because it has a big emphasis on the upper mids and highs which gives it a very bright and lively sound but not one I care for. Some folks may not care at all about bass and this speaker would be great for you. As far as taking this outside it has an outdoor sound button which makes it even louder at the cost of losing any sound quality it had.Overall there are lot of better choices out there in this price range and cheaper price ranges that surpass the sound quality of this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2022",AFLUZV54ZUQSQ3YSXRWXCSEU5JSA,TRUE,52,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3

Sanchez,5,"I am an owner of two Sonos home speakers: the One and the One SL. These are amazing sounding speakers that are easy to use. While I love these speakers, they are not portable as they must stay plugged into an outlet in order to work. I looked at the Sonos Move but was turned off by the size of the speaker and the high price. Needless to say, when Sonos introduced the Roam, I was intrigued. I got it as a father's day gift and what follows are my thoughts on the new Sonos Roam.SoundMy main concern with the Roam was that I noticed it was rather small and how that would effect the sound quality and loudness of the speaker. I was foolish for thinking this however. Sonos is known for having excellent sounding speakers and they would not jeopardize that reputation by putting out a new product that didn't adhere to their high audio standards. This speaker sounds amazing! Music sounds rich and full of depth. The clarity of the highs is excellent and the bass is surprisingly rich and full. Further to the point, the Sonos app allows you to tailor the sound to your liking, adding more of less treble and/or bass. I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the audio quality of this diminutive speaker.As a secondary point under sound, I was also concerned about how loud the speaker could get. Indoors, this little gem can get plenty loud and fill a large space with amazing sound. Outdoors, the Roam does a better than adequate job of projecting great music. I have taken it in my backyard while doing some yard work and it gets loud enough to hear and enjoy the music. However, I don't think Sonos designed this speaker to pump out the tunes at the pool party or at the beach like the EU Boom 3 or other larger bluetooth speakers. It can function adequately in that role but excels in smaller spaces and in overall sound quality.FunctionalityThe speaker works seamlessly with my other two Sonos speakers via WiFi using the Sonos app. The ability to move the speaker all over the house is a major plus. I can configure the Roam to play alone or with either one or both of my other speakers. I love that versatility. The buttons have some straight forward uses and also are multi-functional, which can take some getting used to. For example, I have issues sometimes with the power button and how long to push it. Five seconds to turn it off, a quick push to put it in sleep mode to save power. Same with the play/pause button: once to pause music, twice to advance to the next song, three times to go back to previous song, press and hold for a second to put the speaker in bluetooth pairing mode, and press and hold and listen for a sound in order to be able to swap your music from the Roam to the closest Sonos speaker or vice versa. It has taken some getting used to initially but I'm getting the hang of it.The battery life is good but I wish it were better. I get about 8 hours of play time per charge. Charging is another small issue. Sonos includes a USB-C (plugs into speaker) to USB-A (plugs into charger) charging cable with the speaker, but they do not include a charging adapter to plug into the wall. Luckily, I have an Apple iPad USB-C to USB-C cable with a large 20w charging adapter that charges the Roam very quickly. I highly recommend the larger charging adapter to greatly reduce charging time. As a side note, the speaker can function fully while being charged.Airplay and bluetooth connectivity are straightforward and work well. I have not had any issues connecting the speaker via bluetooth to my phone, laptop and various other devices around my home.FormThe speaker works in either a horizontal or vertical position with some claiming there is a difference in the sound. That is a matter of preference as I like both positions for different reasons. Horizontally, the speaker is designed to project the sound up and it seems to use the surface the speaker is sitting on to amplify the sound. Vertically it sounds great and it is much easier to access the control buttons on top. Ultimately, I love the design of the Roam because it is small, clean and elegant looking.In my opinion, the Sonos Roam is an excellent speaker because of its portability, convenience of use within my existing Sonos system, and its superb audio performance.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2021",AF6SKKQSAPY2Q4GAS2DOPQBL7SOA,TRUE,194,Size: SingleColor: White

I love to use it at home as desktop airplay speaker. One thing I experienced one time is when the speaker reached ~40% battery the airplay connection started to failed, sound was cutting really bad and I was not able to play continuously. not even I turned off/on. Once I connected to the power the problem was fixed so I am not sure if that was a glitch or something real. A second thing I don't like is that currently you have to open the SONOS app to check the battery level while airplaying it , I wish you can do the same from the airplay menu maybe that is an apple problem. Difficult to write about sound quality, I can only tell how it sounds compare to a apple homepod mini (similar sound quality less loud) , Bose Micro soundlink (Sonos has much better sound quality and louder) Bose Mini soundlink (Sonos has better sound quality, less bass, less loud) JBL clip 4 (sonos has ultra much better quality ). Overall I think this is the best small/micro sound system in the market, don't buy JBL clip 4 or Bose micro soundlink those are trash compare to this one.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFXJZ2PDN44L26NJFK2TGXKXTWXQ,TRUE,25,Size: SingleColor: Black

This thing definitely does not have the somewhat richer sound of a One. Being able to pop the plug and take it with me is great and the battery life is excellent but the Roam has some pretty significant flaws that would make me not recommend it.It has very fine-grained volume controls yet everything below about 25% is almost completely inaudible. With other Sonos products you can comfortably set the volume to 10% and have an enjoyable listening experience. With the Roam you're going to literally wonder if it's on at all until you turn it up to about 28. It doesn't matter what source you use -- a test signal at full signal won't even be audible in the lower 20% of the volume band.This leads to the second problem: if you set the volume to a point where you can actually hear music, the Alexa voice is EAR SHATTERINGLY LOUD. If you set the volume to the point where Alexa isn't trying to make you have a heart attack, your music is inaudible.The software's a bit buggy as well. It can't be paired with any of your other speakers but it can be grouped with them. If you group the Roam with another speaker that's playing you have about a 50/50 shot of it just not doing anything at all. It'll be connected, the controls will respond, it'll be visible in the app as grouped, you just won't get any audio. After a little fooling around with it, you can sometimes work around the problem by starting the playback on the Roam and grouping something else to it. Adding the Roam to a group doesn't work reliably at all.Some other software bugs make this thing a bit less fun. While it remembers if it was last used in Bluetooth or in Sonos mode and will return to the selected mode when turned on again, it's not very reliable to switch between modes. This isn't something you normally have to do often unless you take your Roam out of the house a lot; just leaving it in the Sonos network is viable wherever your WiFi reaches. Take it on a trip, though, and you're going to spend the first 4 or 5 minutes trying to get it to actually switch into Bluetooth mode.Re-pairing the Bluetooth is similarly annoying. It doesn't pair with more than a single device so it's extra steps for switching who's DJing. This isn't a problem while the Roam is at home and participating in your Sonos setup, of course.My real complaint, though, and something that was exceedingly poorly documented when the product was released is that it DOES NOT PAIR WITH ANYTHING except another Roam.Battery life, as I said, is great. This comes at something of a cost, though: this sucker is way heavier than it looks. Personally, I'd have preferred half the (excellent!) battery life if it meant more room in there for better actual speakers. The audio is, really, barely passable at best and outright embarrassing for something Sonos branded.It is not tunable with TruePlay. It claims to have some kind of automatic TruePlay learning mode but I have not in any way noticed an improvement in the disappointing sound quality with it running.The Roam is definitely better than a no-name Bluetooth speaker you'd buy at Target. That faint praise is the strongest endorsement I can give it. If you want to pay nearly two Franklins for something that sounds pretty close to a $16 thing you bought when you went to pick up motor oil, the Roam is it.","Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2022",AGZ4XODB2UJ4NPOBG5WUPBF6JYIA,TRUE,96,Size: SingleColor: Black

It took days to sort out the issue which required my own workaround.Sonos has been trying to force the software update to the S2 app, which will not work with my older equipment. When trying to set up the Roam, I installed the S2 app, connected to a separate Wi-Fi network, but, as many users report, I could not set up a new account as any email address I entered was reported as ‚Äúalready in use‚Äù, which was impossible. Once I called Sonos, that issue disappeared which is suspicious. I wonder if they have something internal to prevent this.Sonos support told me to unplug all my devices, then set up the Roam on a split system which I refused to do as I did not want to risk my old equipment not working. Once you set up S2, you cannot revert back, so do not do this.I ignored their advice, and was somehow able to create the new Sonos account and activate my Roam. All that should be unnecessary for users like me that only want it for Bluetooth play.To Sonos - if you want to be in the Bluetooth market, change your software to enable Bluetooth only and stop trying to force loyal customers to the S2.

Try again. You have to login again - Wife says F this and let me use the old device8. Try again - it finally connects and downloads the new software.9.

First, nothing about this set up is intuitive. The instructions are a joke, because they are almost non-existent. I spent two hours figuring out the steps through a myriad of YouTube videos, the Sonos website, and following the instructions on the app. First you need to download the app, set up an account, and connect to your Wifi and Bluetooth (if you want Bluetooth), information which is non-existent in the sparse instructions. Another feature that could use improvement are the buttons. The top with the volume and mike controls are hard to see and the button on the back is a bit funky. I didn't rate this product on the battery life since I've only had it for a short time. The saving grace for this product is the sound quality, which seems fairly good. Sonos could improve this product in a number of ways, so if you purchase it, the speaker seems good enough for the price, but unless you are a total techie, be prepared to fiddle around with the set-up---it's no cake walk.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2023",AFBMRJ5DK2Y5LKIM54JW5A5DK7ZA,TRUE,8,Size: SingleColor: Black

Multi room audio and portable audio from lots of other manufacturers has gotten just as good or better than Sonos these days.UPDATE just want to say that this device is by far the worst portable speaker I have ever seen. Unknown to me my girlfriend bought this because we were going on vacation. Getting aside from that fact that this device MUST be setup on wi-fi before it can be used (it thinks that a Hampton Inn in Miami is the ""home"" wifi), we had to reset this device no less than 6 times. Just like with mine half the time it had no battery, but even better when we would try to charge it, all we would get is a solid orange light. It would never charge, and would not turn on. If we unplugged/replugged the power tons of times, eventually it would start charging, but frequently would not connect to the wifi and would not show up in anyone's bluetooth. Can't tell you how frustrating this was, resetting the device, resetting the app, trying both of our phones. Maddening. She ended up returning it and getting a normal UE Megaboom bluetooth speaker, that thing is a joy to use and is actually reliable unlike the Sonos junk.

For a while I was quite happy, as I could listen to both streaming services and my large library of music that is not available on streaming services. If I wanted to add a song to my current queue, it was a simple 2 click operation.However, for some reason, they decided to roll out an app update that eliminated all options to modify the current queue. In addition, they app has no ability to modify system settings, so when I changed my wifi password (which I do on a monthly basis), I lost the connection to all of my devices.

I promise you will love these especially if you catch them on sale Like I did ($225, taxes included)Sound:The bass is the first thing anyone can notice from these. The amount of bass you get out of a speaker these size is rather impressive and feels rich. The mids are very clear, crisp, and full of life. The highs are present in good quantities and finely detailed. I listen to a variety of music and these speakers can handle everything from classical to pop and rap(where it truly shines) my favorite part about the speakers is that they adapt to wherever they are place to sound best. For example let's say I place then in the corner of a room, it will modify the way it sounds to blast the sounds off the wall best.It does similar adaptations if placed near a single wall, center of the room, or even hanging from a headphone rack next to my computer.Battery:Although I haven't fully done a battery test I can tell you that they will last at least 16 hours of sporadic use before it asks for some juice. I personally would spend the extra cash on a charging dock. My speaker for some reason has issues registering when it's connected to a charger via its micro USB port. I have to turn on the speaker first in order for it to start charging. It's a weird glitch but it doesn't bother much since the battery lasts a while. Based on my usage (at home and at work) I only charge them about 3 times a full week.Pairing/Connectivity:Right out of the box when you turn in the speaker you will receive voice prompts on how to set up the speaker which is pretty straightforward. I can be about 90 feet away and in another room without having connectivity issues. I cannot recall what Bluetooth version these are on. I'll update the review after I figure it out. It does however support being connected to 2 soundlink devices at once. I have 3 different soundlink speakers being the Micro, the Revolve, and the Revolve+, and they all pair with each other flawlessly. I suggest installing the Bose connect app since it is just much simpler connecting things from the app. You can also connect to the speaker even if it's off as long as you have paired to it previously which I think is great. Lol saves me the energy to physically turn them on.","Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2019",AHGR5XXDGZNMWJ24LS3EUGC44XLQ,TRUE,5,Color: Triple Black

I have high end home audio for surround system. (Not Bose) For portable speakers I have owner the Bose SoundDock version I, II and III as well as the Bose Soundtouch 20 Series III, a Jawbone Big Jambox and Sonos Play 5. Wired speakers typically will sound better than portable because you have the extra power and built-in amplifier to drive it. My Sonos Play 5 has clear big sound and plays to very loud levels if needed. Love that speaker. The Soundtouch 20 also plays clear and loud and is punchy with bass. All my speakers serve a purpose and you need to decide what is most important to you. The non-battery portable speakers are great around my house, but I also like to cut the cord and take a speaker outside, to the beach, vacation, etc. I had been using my older Jambone Big Jambox which is a great speaker for its size and has clear sound and nice mid-range, but now 6 years old. Was looking to replace it with something that had long battery life, sounded clear with no distortion and plays to louder levels for outside. This Soundlink Revolve+ is simply amazing for its size. While not the biggest fan of Bose sound in home audio surround systems, I think they do an excellent job of producing great sound on smaller portable speakers. The Bose corporate ‚Äúsound‚Äù can be equalized and bloated, but comes off warm and clear on the Revolve+. The sound never distorts at any level. What really amazes me is the bass out of this thing. Don't expect bass thumping and wall rattling sound, but compared to any portable speaker its size, nothing will beat this. Even better bass extension if you place closer to a wall. The first night I used it was in an outdoor deck gazebo with a few couples we had over. Everyone was shocked at the sound. Even in an open aired environment it sounded great. This speaker will go loud as well. Plenty loud for what I need it to do. Sixteen hour battery life is excellent as well. I downloaded the Bose app and while not fancy, lets you control more things and music playing through it. Also shows battery life on app. The speaker pairs instantly which is great too. Turn it on and it auto connects to the phone if previously added. You can add multiple phones as well in the list. The big test was when four of us were sitting in the four seasons room and I had it on the floor next to fireplace. We had at it low to medium levels while we were all talking. I kept finding myself looking down and seeing how small it was yet the sound was so much bigger. The carry handle is nice and overall look and design of it as well. Very portable. I really have no complaints about it and how it performs. Only thing of course would be wishing it were less money. However, you do get what you pay for here. I highly recommend this portable speaker and the splash proof, water resistant aspect is just a bonus. Go buy one and you won't regret it if on the fence.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2018",AFJD6JUEL2MVQPDKANVKKUAEV24Q,TRUE,9,Color: Triple Black

Very clear sound, the bass could be a bit more but I won't hold that against it as it is a stand alone speaker. I read in the description that they could be paired to work with the Echo Dot, which is the reason I bought this speaker in the first place. I got the first one and loved the full rich sound it played so I ordered a second to check out the pairing capabilities. The instructions to pair are not listed here at Amazon. I had no luck getting them to pair and Amazon Customer Service told me that stand alone speakers can not be paired with the Echo Dot or any of the other Alexa items. They told me if they come already paired then it would work. I had a fit trying to get them paired on my own with no luck. I eventually went to Bose and the instructions are there and very easy to follow. Here are the instructions I used from the owners manual.Keep in mind, you must pair the speakers together before you start playing any music utilizing your Alexa Item.Party mode1. Make sure both speakers are powered on.2. Make sure a speaker is connected to your mobile device.3.

I have not tried them in Stereo Mode yet but plan on doing so later. With Party Mode you get the same sound from both speakers. It is my understanding that in Stereo Mode the music would be split between the two speakers as it would be on your home stereo speakers. If you want better sound from your Alexa item I highly recommend this speaker. Pairing two together is the ultimate sound you can get from your Alexa Item playing through these speakers.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2017",AGYW4BBQCL6B4KBYDYOXOIR5QBIQ,TRUE,8,Color: Triple Black

I have a lot of them and always continue to find a way to buy more. I really don't like Bose that much but that pretty much turned around once I spent time with this speaker. So let me tell you about it and compare it to one of my favorites. The Sony SRS XB31The build quality of this is great and I love the aluminum. It is very durable and I haven't quite scratched it yet which says a lot because I'm rough on electronics. I also took this on vacation and it still looks great. The Sony feel a little cheaper but holds up well. Overall 10/10 Sound quality is amazing though you get better bass on the xb31 and maybe a tad more volume. The highs are crisp and not over powering. the mids are very much there and theres not too much of it. The bass gets louder the more you turn it up and is very punchy. I will note that I use this with a galaxy note 8 and YouTube music/GP music. Overall 8/10The battery is great I use this thing all day and by the time I get to the end of the day its like at 50% at the very least. The xb31 is a little less great but still lasts very long. Overall 9/10.Price was the thing I had to overlook to get this and its the main reason I don't like Bose. It is definitely not worth $300 and as soon as these go on sale grab one ASAP. You can also get an xb31 or even the bigger 41 for a lot cheaper and with those you get lights. 5/10Overall its a great speaker and I love it. But the price is a little bit high and you could get a lot of other speakers for a lot cheaper. If you want a ""cheap"" speaker that sounds great and don't care a lot about the look or material look at the Sony SRS XB31-41. If you want durable metal, pleasing looks, and good 360¬∞ sound and maybe also don't care about the price. Get this it is worth it.That's if for this review and I suppose I'll leave some pics for you guys","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2019",AE4PKEST3YSIIQ36FLJRPPYIKRFA,TRUE,2,Color: Triple Black

Ended up liking HK Onyx Studio 5 more.",Andre LeBlanc,4,"PREFACE: Any time you read a review about speakers that was not conducted in a lab with calibrated tools, it is going to be subjective. This review is subjective. It means that the results of my test are only as I my ears & brain perceive them. Everyone hears the exact same audio differently. Everyone has a preference as to what sounds ‚Äúbest‚Äù. You hear people refer to music as ‚Äúwarm‚Äù or ‚Äúbright‚Äù or ‚Äútiring‚Äù or ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù. I like to think of it like this: You probably have an EQ on your car radio or home audio system. How do you have it set? What does the ‚Äòcurve‚Äô look like? Some people don‚Äôt like the obnoxious thump of bass, so they turn that frequency range down. Some people don‚Äôt like the ‚Äòhissing‚Äô sound of cymbals, so they turn those frequencies down. My preference is a curve that is high on the ends (Bass and Treble) and low in the middle (Midrange). This directly impacts what is heard in music.This particular review is specific to the Harman Kardon Onyx series and the Bose SoundLink Revolve+. My spending cap was $300 on Amazon, so that ruled out other speakers like the Vifa Oslo and B&W Zeppelin. I‚Äôd still like to try the HK Play+Go, but don‚Äôt have the resources right now. (Unless someone would like to gift me one to review üòä)------------------I‚Äôve just spent the past month with the Oontz Angle 3XL Ultra ($100), the DOSS Soundbox XL ($70), Bose SoundLink Revolve+ ($270), the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 1 (n/a), Studio 4 ($175), and Studio 5 ($164).I wanted to find the best speaker that fits MY listening profile. My primary focus is on audio quality via Bluetooth with a $300 max price on Amazon. Other factors like portability, water resistance, and battery life are not heavily weighted for me because this speaker is primarily intended for indoor use with AC power.So‚Ä¶‚ÄùLong review short‚Äù‚Ä¶my preference in order of ‚ÄúBest‚Äù to ‚ÄúReally Good‚Äù. (None of them are bad.)The HK Onyx Studio 5 is my favorite. Why? It sounds the best (to me) and costs the least.Followed by the Onyx 4, and then the Bose Revolve+. The HK Onyx 1 is purely for reference and is no longer available to purchase. I decided not to include the Oontz and the DOSS in this writeup because after hours of testing, they just aren‚Äôt in the same game, let alone same sport. They will have a separate review. (Summary of that review: Get the DOSS @$70 or spend an extra $100 to get the HK Onyx Studio 5. That extra $100 will easily justify itself after years of listening pleasure!)To get the speakers setup, all speakers were plugged in to AC power. If a speaker had an available firmware update, it was applied. All speakers were connected via Bluetooth to an iPhone XS. I used the Amazon Music app (w/full Amazon Music subscription) to test. I selected specific songs that I know well across a variety of music types. The following is a small sampling of the Artists & Albums. Some albums I listened to in their entirety, some I just chose particular songs.Techmaster PEB ‚Äì BassgasmChris Stapleton ‚Äì TravellerDonovan ‚Äì Beat Caf√©Christian McBride ‚Äì Live at TonicPink Floyd ‚Äì Dark Side Of The MoonGustav Holst ‚Äì The PlanetsAudiolab ‚Äì Audio Test TonesThe first thing I wanted was something that matched my listening preference as noted above. An upside-down bell curve. Strong bass and treble, and a flat midrange. To me, too much lower-midrange causes most music to sound muddy. Too much higher-midrange and it sounds hollow or echo-y.The Bose is definitely last place in the bass frequencies. Its single, smaller downfiring speaker just isn‚Äôt up to the task of creating bass you can actually feel (or hear at the really low frequencies). You can tell the Bose unit is making an effort, but it doesn‚Äôt have that deep sound that you get from the larger drivers on the HK Onyx units, particularly the Onyx Studio 4 & 5. I did try to cheat a little with the Bose by putting it on a surface that would allow it to act like a bass transducer. Unfortunately for that idea, Bose does a fantastic job of isolating its sound from the surface it‚Äôs on, so there‚Äôs no buzzing or resonance on any surface. This speaker is not going to vibrate itself off any flat surface.Where the Bose Soundlink Revolve+ shines is because it is a downfiring speaker, it does a much better job dispersing sound evenly throughout a room. The staging of its output just has a certain ‚Äòsomething‚Äô that is best explained by listening and not with words. Unfortunately, while the overall sound is smooth, it‚Äôs missing the low end that I require. Lack of bass response notwithstanding, the Bose most closely resembles the sound of the Onyx 4.Now on to the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio, models 1, 4, and 5.As I noted, the Onyx 1 is for reference. A family member has had it for years and I‚Äôve always been impressed. It was time to see what improvements HK has made to its newer models.The Studio 4 and 5 definitely sound better than the original, but it‚Äôs not a HUGE improvement. If they weren‚Äôt side by side, most people would be hard pressed to discern a difference. The aural differences between the 4 and 5 are even less. What intrigued me the most between the 4 and 5 was HK‚Äôs decision to go from a 2x2 driver setup to a 1x1, respectively. My first thought was that any sound staging would be diminished with the newest model. Surprisingly, there is almost no difference between the two, so ‚Äúprops to HK‚Äù for being able to re-engineer the Onyx Studio 5 for better overall sound. If I didn‚Äôt have all the speakers side by side, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell the difference between the 4 & 5. However, ‚Äòthey were‚Äô so ‚ÄòI could‚Äô. HK‚Äôs switch to the larger woofer in the 5 makes a notable difference, specifically when testing for sub frequencies. Both in music and using the Audiolabs test album, the 5 was absolutely able to respond down to 40Hz. This is also where the Techmaster PEB album came in to play. The Bose wanted nothing to do with it and didn‚Äôt bother to show up to the game. The Onyx Studio 1 at least showed up, but it was the 4 & 5 that actually hit the field to play. The 5 just barely edged out the 4. Again, that single, larger driver in the 5 is what works.The Studio 5 also managed to have better overall staging and ever-so-slightly better vocals and treble.On any albums that have more of a ‚Äúlive‚Äù sound, the 5 fared slightly better, giving the vocals more presence in the room. The Bose also did very well, but the vocals weren‚Äôt quite as forward on the stage.If classical music is more your thing, it‚Äôs a toss up between the Bose and the Onyx Studio 5. Again, the Bose does a fantastic job giving you a full stage of instruments, at the expense of some of them not being quite as crisp or pronounced. You know the individual orchestra pieces are there, but sometimes it sounds like some of them are behind the curtain. Again, it‚Äôs really a toss up. Listening to ‚ÄúHolst: The Planets‚Äù, there are some very quiet moments that both speakers handle with aplomb. In a perfectly quite environment, I suspect classical aficionados may prefer the Bose for the way it separates the stage, even if it‚Äôs only slightly better than the 5.Summary: Reference Graph #2- This unscientific, subjective graph is how I hear their respective tuning. The Onyx 4 has a relatively flat response curve. Hence a bit more of the midrange that I don‚Äôt like. Around 90Hz, the speakers are pretty even. You can see the Bose falls pretty much in line with the Onyx 4 and 5, but seriously lacks the initial bass response, and overcompensates with additional midrange.Thus, as I noted at the beginning, the HK Onyx Studio 5 is the speaker that most closely matches the way I like to hear music and wins the overall award.Now that I‚Äôve determined the speaker that sounds the best to me, let‚Äôs discuss the other factors that distinguish these units.Overall Volume / Loudness:Reference Graph #1This graph is how I perceived their volume at given frequencies. This is a very unscientific way to do this. (Again, it‚Äôs all subjective.) I first set all speakers to approximately the same perceived volume using 1000Hz as the frequency to normalize the volume. The volume does not get adjusted for the remainder of this test. Next, I went back and started with 40Hz and stepped up to 16kHz. The graph represents where I perceived an increase or decrease in volume relative to 1000Hz. This is completely unscientific because higher frequencies will seem louder than lower ones. Once in the higher frequencies, its more about which speaker seemed louder than the other at that frequency. Take the graph for what you will. (I‚Äôm doing this review for free. I‚Äôm not spending the additional time & effort & equipment required to record a channel sweep of each speaker and display the results. *laughing*)Worth noting on this volume graph‚Ä¶ There was essentially no perceived volume at 16kHz. And none of the speakers are crystal clear at their max volume. But this could be due to numerous compounded factors: The encoded bitrate of the Audiolabs album that is streaming from Amazon; The usable frequency spectrum handled by the Bluetooth protocol. From this testing, I also believe that once you push Bluetooth past about 80%, the BT itself becomes the primary source of distortion, not the speaker & its amplifier. If I had done a direct line-in using my actual/physical Test CD, that would entirely eliminate any of those possibilities. Again, I didn‚Äôt feel it worth additional time & effort. üòä- I found it interesting that while the Bose wasn‚Äôt as loud at lower volumes (a percentage of total volume adjustment), ultimately the Bose did play louder than the Onyx 5. It would seem that the Onyx ramps up and plateaus faster. The Bose also had a flatter volume response, whereas the Onyx units got a little peaky in some areas. If someone is paying attention, the graph would seem to run counter to my claim that the Bose was overall louder at max volume. Subjectivity at its finest!- Earlier in my testing with the Bose, I found that controlling volume with the VOL+/- on the iPhone, there are 20 steps. However, using the volume buttons on the speaker, there were 5 steps for every 1 of the phone. So the Bose effectively has a volume adjustment of 0-100 when done manually at the speaker. I did not test manual volume control on the HK units.Portability & Aesthetics:- The Bose Soundlink Revolve+ definitely wins in the portability category. It‚Äôs definitely the lightest of this bunch and it‚Äôs super convenient to just pick it up by the fabric handle and be on your way. It also has the smallest footprint. However, the Bose is going to get dinged a little for its 3ft USB charging cable. 3ft is not a lot when you‚Äôre looking to have your speaker plugged in and use it at the same time. That being said, check out someplace like Amazon/Monoprice for longer USB cables to make this less of an issue.- Neither the 4 nor the 5 are particularly portable, as in, ‚Äúthrow it in a backpack and head out for a day trip‚Äù. The HK Onyx Studio 4 retains the same general setup since the original. A cup on the top-back to carry it, and two non-detachable legs sticking out the lower back. On the Studio 5, HK changed it up and went to a design that now looks more like a woman‚Äôs handbag, having a full handle on top. The Studio 5 is also quite a bit heavier than the 4. The plus side to it being a heavyweight is that it stays where you put it and is less prone to vibrate the surface it‚Äôs on. When specifically comparing the Studio 4 to the 5, the 4 seems like it would fall over easier if something knocked it from behind. That‚Äôs just an observation and not a likely scenario.- Of the four units, I like the Bose the best for button layout. The Onyx 1 & 4 next. The Onyx 5 is the least favorable for button layout. It hides its buttons on the top-front of the speaker fabric. And the audible feedback of the HK isn‚Äôt nearly as intuitive as the Bose. The Bose talks at you; The HKs just play tones (most of the time).- Due to the downfiring, 360¬∞ nature of the Bose SoundLink Revolve+, I think if you had high ceilings and hung them like light fixtures, the audio in the room would be amazing! Or if you‚Äôre using them outside, hang them on some really tall Shepard‚Äôs Hooks. Technically, you could do the same thing with the Onyx Studio 5, but the speaker is much more directional, so you‚Äôd probably want to have them in corners firing inward.Serviceability:I‚Äôm only calling this out because the original Onyx Studio 1 had both a removable grill so you could see all the speakers, as well as the ability to open up the body and replace any component, including the failed rechargeable battery (which I replaced while reviewing this lineup). The Bose and newer HK Onyx‚Äôs are sealed up tight with no apparent way to crack ‚Äòem open.Extra features:- As I noted in the beginning, extra features aren‚Äôt really on my radar. I want a speaker that plays my music. The other stuff doesn‚Äôt really concern me as much.- The Bose and HKs are able to wirelessly connect to similar units. However, the Onyx Studio 5 is only able to pair up with other Studio 5. It doesn‚Äôt have HKConnect technology, so you can‚Äôt connect it to any previous Onyx models. As such, it‚Äôs also not recognized by the HKConnect app.Reviews for all the speakers have plenty of people complaining about the ability to pair their speaker with the exact same model. It would seem that grass isn‚Äôt perfectly green on either side of this fence.- I think both the HK and Bose handle incoming phone calls‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt try.- The Bose I received had an available firmware update that went very smooth. I hooked up the speaker to my Windows 10 system and it recognized it without issue. I downloaded Bose‚Äôs Windows app and updated the firmware without issue.Looking at HK‚Äôs site, neither the 4 nor 5 appeared to have a firmware update.Battery life:I didn‚Äôt do any rundown tests. I‚Äôm going to keep my speaker on a shelf and/or near AC power, so battery life isn‚Äôt a big factor for me. I will say that the Bose clearly speaks its battery capacity when you turn it on. It also speaks the name of exactly it‚Äôs connecting to. That‚Äôs a nice feature I wish the HK‚Äôs had.Price:As of this writing, the HK Onyx Studio 5 currently is the least expensive of this group. And it‚Äôs my favorite sounding speaker! That‚Äôs a WIN for me! The Onyx Studio 4‚Äôs audio quality is right up there in a close 2nd place to the 5, but it‚Äôs currently more expensive. And then there‚Äôs the Bose which is currently selling for more than $100 over the Onyx Studio 5. Apparently, you are going to pay for the Bose name and portability. And possibly the battery life or other features I didn‚Äôt cover. The Bose is nice, but I‚Äôll keep the extra $100 thankyouverymuch!All in all, if you‚Äôre not nearly as particular as me, any of these three speakers will treat you well. I‚Äôm obviously recommending the HK Onyx Studio 5 because it sounds the best and cost the least. However, if you aren‚Äôt nearly as picky and have a concrete spend limit of $100, I‚Äôd go with the DOSS Soundbox XL for $70.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2019",AFXOEPJXKWZWSNDC57VP4TBJEC6A,TRUE,14,Color: Lux Gray

And the Bose Soundlink Revolve + delivers the best quality sound for its size, weight and portability. Its the SOUND QUALITY that matters...the primary job of a speaker! Right??This is not my first rodeo with portable blue tooth speakers. I have (or had) a number of them including the Jawbone BIG Jambox, the Jawbone (regular size) Jambox, JBL Flip, JBL Flip 3, JBL Charge 2+, and when I really what to rock the patio, the Braven XXL. My main priority? SOUND QUALITY for its given size/weight. Do I really think I am going to throw my speaker in a pool? Really? So water proofing is not important to me. Do I care if 10 of friends want to hook up to my speaker? Matter of fact, I do...and don't want them to have that access.Do I want/need 360 degree sound? Is that important to me? Not at all. I simply want to hear (and feel) the lows all the way up to a drummer playing on the Hi-hat highs. Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" is a good test song for me. The bass, drums and rhythm section really push the bass with solid earthy tones. The crispness (is that a word?) of the snare drum and Hi-Hat pushes the top end of the listening spectrum, and Bose delivers on it IF.......you don't put the Soundlink Revolve + in a middle of a room. Put it about an inch from a wall ON A HARD SURFACE. There will be night and day difference in the SOUND QUALITY. Better yet, put it about an inch away from CORNER wall where you have 3 hard surfaces reflecting the sound as a speaker itself. My kitchen CORNER counter top behind works great! Try it yourself. I have hard wood floors, so sometimes, I put the speaker on the floor, in a corner and BOOM...what sound! And clean sound too!The battery life is nice (and expected) and I'll admit, that nylon carrying handle comes in handy, but most of the features are NOT important to me but the really reason, I bought this speaker...QUALITY SOUND for its size, portability and weight.

I discovered that Bose released a spiritual successor to the SoundLink Mini / Mini II a few months ago and bought one within 15 seconds of my discovery. Shame on me for not knowing sooner.A bit of history: I bought the Mini a few after it was released. I thought - goodness gracious that sounds good for something I could slip in my pocket. It doesn't get super-loud; even at its own maximum volume the bass is badly washed out; producing its best performance really requires thoughtful placement. It must be backed up within a foot (or less) of a good solid vertical surface. On the upside: it attempts to attack bass frequencies that numerous speakers 5X its size filter out altogether. It's my ""featherweight champion"". Step up into a mid-size portable speaker and the Klipsch KMC-3 just walks away with it - and another speaker I bought and kept, the Bang & Olufsen Beolit 15 (see comparison photo beside Revolve+ attached), is similarly big-sounding, punchy, expansive and crisp, just sort of delivers its performance differently than the Klipsch and maybe with less WOOF. Both, masterpieces of listening enjoyment, for all kinds of music. But the kind of sound the SoundLink Mini could generate at moderate listening levels and in any environment just make it lovable - a real ""WOW"" moment when someone hears the kind of sound it can produce. Oh... and it's attractive. And well-made. And did I say, tiny? I like it so much (and my wife more or less expropriated the original Mini to carry all over the house and yard for kid-time and chores and exercise and such) that I bought a Mini II shortly after it came out, as a travel buddy on business trips.Back to the little guys. I've tried many. Not all, but many. Perhaps better than thirty makes and models in the ""mini"" and ""mid-size"" portable Bluetooth speaker ranges and the SoundLink Mini kept knocking them all down in the ""ultra-portable"" speaker form factor. For years, I've been bemoaning the lack of competent competition for this little guy. There really was none. Even as recently as... last week... I bought the theoretically estimable KEF Gravity One, same form factor as the SoundLink Mini and maybe 50% larger, but in theory, with dominant sound... and... woah. No. No, once again the SoundLink Mini slays a powerful foe. Yet again, I whined that nobody seems to be able to outdo the SoundLink Mini... including Bose themselves.When I found these SoundLink Revolve speakers were the successor to the SoundLink Mini I had VERY high expectations. Bose must have taken an excellent, industry-leading mini portable speaker and made it even better.The verdict: maybe it's better - but different. Not just a clear head-and-shoulders better-than-SoundLink Mini win.I would say, with bass response the Mini wins. Using a tone generator, the Mini is maybe -1 or 2db below 60Hz and inaudible under 45Hz. With the Revolve+, it's quieter under about 58Hz and disappears at 38Hz. On the face of it you'd think, good, slightly deeper bass, if only by a hair. But, the Revolve seems not to be able to emphasize, or project, those tones, especially around 60-80Hz, as well as the Mini. It's there, but it just doesn't balance out with the mids and treble as well as the Mini.The trade-off is soundstage. With the Mini, the sweet spot is pretty much a laser beam directly facing the front of the speaker. With the Revolve+, it REALLY doesn't matter which direction it's pointing - play your favorite song, pick up the speaker and rotate it in your hand, there's truly no distinction, no variation, at any point 360 degrees around the vertical axis of the unit. I'll also point out that the sound quality is nearly identical no matter where you are vertically - above, below, eye level with the speaker grille. So, one thing it does exceptionally well is actually filling the space around it with the music.The Revolve+ gets quite a bit louder than the Mini, but at the same time, similar to the Mini, the ""loudness"" of the mids and treble quickly defeats its ability to make bass and you end up with a sort of tinny, washed out one-dimensional blaring noise. It gets loud... but you wouldn't want to have to listen to it that way. It can, but you don't want it to. Similar to the Mini, the best sound is at low to moderate volumes.Aesthetically... it's a music lantern. A music canister. If you took it camping and felt for it in the dark, you might not be able to tell if you grabbed the speaker or the kerosene lamp. By way of lanterns, it's a very nice one indeed. The Mini is a brilliant, chic, retro shape with modern materials. This... not so much. The shell is aluminum and feels very solid to hold, but the feel doesn't save the looks. I guess there's really only so much you can do to have a real 360 degree portable speaker that doesn't look like a can or lantern. I don't have any bright ideas. Just pointing out that vs. the Mini, this isn't something you'd put on an executives' bookshelf and say, yeah, look at that. Nice huh? It definitely belongs on a picnic table alongside the ketchup and plate of hot dogs.And quite to that point - the sound quality seems to be precisely the same model. The Mini seems to have been designed first and foremost to pack a little tiny proper audiophile-quality listening experience into a little tiny package. It has a narrow soundstage, depends on positioning to really make the bass resonate, but boy, when you hear it performing, does it ever perform. This one is designed more to be a Good listening experience, but for everybody. Less on perfecting the sound, more on making it fill the space around it entirely. This is designed for parties. The Mini is designed for desks, bookshelves and kitchen counters.Going back and forth between the Mini II and the Revolve+, sitting right in front of me, on the same shelf, playing the same tracks, I still think I like the Mini's sound a notch better. The Revolve+ isn't bad at all, it's just different. Nevertheless, I''ll most likely keep the Revolve+. Keeping pace with the Mini already puts it beyond any competitor. I'll use this outside, maybe for parties out on the deck.Happy listening!","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2017",AGWPYUXR43CM7C5CYUE4SUEC62QA,TRUE,137,Color: Lux Gray

It has pretty decent sound for its size, however it is also a bit overpriced, and quite frankly overrated. You can spend much less and get a similar enough result. I have had some issues with it, but from many reviews I‚Äôve read and experiences I‚Äôve had, I believe it‚Äôs reasonable to expect some connectivity problems and such with modern technology, especially bluetooth, and when you have so many different types of devices that have to communicate with each other etc.The Why:To start, I was basically looking for some computer speakers for my work pc. A co-worker had purchased an inexpensive soundbar for her pc and that inspired me to get something. So in my search I looked at many options and decided to go Bluetooth and to pony up and go high end, thus this Bose Soundlink Revolve+ is what I purchased on 3-11-19 on sale for $239 (I do like a bargain).Although I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with Bose products, I do understand they are well known for engineering their systems for optimum sound. That said, I‚Äôve been building car audio systems as a hobby for decades now. When designing a subwoofer enclosure, it‚Äôs key to design it correctly and tune it to the right frequency that works best for the subwoofer you‚Äôre installing. I not only can get a lot of volume, but extremely fantastic sound quality which is more important to me now. The richness of the bass from the systems I‚Äôve created has been unsurpassed in my experience. Not trying to toot my own horn, just making the statement because this Bose unit is quite underwhelming for sound quality in my opinion comparatively. However, I wouldn‚Äôt expect much from such a small enclosure. To get a proper bass sound wave, you need the space, volume, and large enough speaker to create it. Bose engineers their systems to trick the science and make better sound from smaller spaces, however, there are limitations that even they can‚Äôt overcome. There‚Äôs only so much you can do with that space. Even though I‚Äôm used to a much higher quality of sound, this has really good sound for what it is. Coincidentally, other Bose systems I‚Äôve listened to also don‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations with the lower frequencies. They do seem to have clear highs and mid range though. For example, my ‚Äò06 Cadillac STS has a Bose system in it with a built in Sub and 17 speakers in all. Since I added my own subwoofer, this is literally the best sounding system I‚Äôve ever heard as Bose does provide excellent sound quality other than the richness of bass in my opinion, but they are pretty good. I think it‚Äôs also noteworthy that this is a matter of opinion as well. Just because I like something or think it should be a certain way, doesn‚Äôt mean others will. And it doesn‚Äôt make me right. So I don‚Äôt want to judge the unit on sound quality alone. Is it worth over $200 to get the sound quality it provides? Maybe, but for much less money there are alternatives that may suit your needs equally as well.So, I now had this awesome little Bluetooth speaker that I could take with me when not at work if I wanted, and be able to use there. So far so good. It was easy enough to set up and it seemed to work well at first. I just left it plugged in and on at all times (I often leave my PC on when I leave for the day as well).However it stopped charging and at the beginning of October the battery went critically low. So, I tried just leaving it on the charger without using it for a few days and nothing. It didn‚Äôt matter which outlet I used or anything. It just simply didn‚Äôt work. Meanwhile I purchased a Oontz Angle 3 for $25.99 here on Amazon in early October because I kind of thought the Bose was done. I didn‚Äôt give up on the Bose completely though. I researched online, looked through the manual, and tried a different charging cord (Not a Bose one but at this point what was it going to hurt?). I determined the charger wasn‚Äôt working and ended up getting it charged with a different charger. I‚Äôve since used the Bose charger again and it does work again. Not sure why it wasn‚Äôt working earlier. I started using it again about mid October. The charging issue was gone and now it charges fine.Then I encountered some weird things with the volume where I couldn‚Äôt adjust the volume anymore from the PC. This was especially annoying when in virtual meetings, but I ended up changing to using the other Bose option (Headphones) from the PC and that worked again.Skip ahead to about a week or two ago, I started getting this weird thing on my PC where any sound file, video, anything like that would have an issue when I started playing where it would play normally for about 1 second, then it would keep playing but I wouldn‚Äôt hear sound for 5 - 10 seconds, then the sound would come back. So every time I opened a video or sound file, I would have to let that happen, then ‚Äúrewind‚Äù it to hear what I missed. I was getting ready to do a help desk ticket when I thought to check a different speaker source to rule that out. Sure enough, it‚Äôs the Bose causing this issue, not my PC. So I‚Äôm currently using my $26 Oontz and it works very well. For about a tenth of the price! I will admit the sound quality isn‚Äôt quite as good on the Oontz as the Bose, but for me, neither are what I truly desire, so good enough for its intended use.12-7-20: I ended up ‚Äúuninstalling‚Äù the Bose from the pc and re-connected it and it appears to be working normally again.Here is my opinion. I believe Bose does put a lot of engineering into their products, but I also think that depending on what you‚Äôre looking for, you might want to consider a less expensive option if you‚Äôre a true audiophile like me as you might not get the true sound you‚Äôre seeking? Although I believe overall this unit is pretty decent and possibly works just fine as it may have for many others, I will recommend just saving your money and buying a less expensive BT speaker. Mine was on sale for $239 but I think there are plenty of less expensive similar choices. It‚Äôs not so much about it being subpar or failing, but more about just simply the amount of bang for your buck. Also, due to having the issues I've had, I knocked a few stars off the rating.","Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2019",AFDJ52CJ3ZJXH2T55QFTNWJHFPZQ,TRUE,10,Color: Triple Black

The buttons are solid feeling, it has a good weight to it overall and the handle is very solid. Nothing but the best from Bose.Functionality ‚Äì This is where the speaker loses a star for me. It‚Äôs not a huge deal but I was disappointed that the speaker came fully discharged and there was no indication that a complete charging cycle was needed before the first use. I know this seems petty but it almost made me feel as though I received a defective unit as the Bluetooth connection dropped multiple times and was even rendered completely useless at one point even though it was plugged into the wall. After 30-40 minutes of frustration, I decided to leave the speaker charging and actually open the instruction manual. (Something I never do, LOL) The quick start guide simply stated to choose the language, pair and listen. While it instructed you to plug it in, it never said to let it charge for a while before use. (which was the only way I found it usable out of the box) Also, the full instruction manual is only available online. I respect the ‚ÄúGo Green‚Äù approach but in a situation like this, it was a tad bit frustrating.The speaker is drop and water resistant, which is a big plus. I haven‚Äôt purposely tested either of these yet but it seems very solid and I would have no concerns with leaving it out in the rain or an occasional splash from the pool.The speaker boasts 16 hours of battery life and I‚Äôve found this to be right on if the device is fully charged. This is more than enough for a long summer BBQ out in the sun. The battery is by far one of the most amazing features of the Bose Revolve +.App ‚Äì Honestly, the app doesn‚Äôt add much for me. It‚Äôs a rather basic app and I find myself reverting to the music app on my iPhone rather than using the limited controls within the Bose application. One bonus the app does provide is the ‚ÄúParty Mode‚Äù which allows two Soundlink Speakers to be paired at the same time. This would be great but with the price of the unit, I will be waiting a while before I invest in a second speaker.Overall ‚Äì In conclusion, this is a great speaker and I highly doubt there will be any cases of buyer‚Äôs remorse. If you‚Äôre willing to pay the price, you will not be disappointed. There were some small setbacks in some of the initial setup but nothing to really write home about. There was a firmware update that popped up today as well, not sure if that helped tweak some of the issues I described earlier with the Bluetooth connectivity and charging or not but will update if so. I love the speaker and hope to get a matching one in the near future.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2017",AHW3ZHH7XNGKXYOKAWYE2J7G2LWA,TRUE,183,Color: Triple Black

That's the only issue i've ever had with Bose- They are simply one of those few companies that care about making an insanely good product that lasts.I recommend (speaking of crap that DOESN""T last, getting magnetic charging port adapters on amazon. They are little plugs for phone etc that stay plugged in and cable attaches to them. This will keep the port from fatiguing. Also, they attach themselves without you having to take your eyes off the road to fumble with plugs. They're cheap.. they're made in a place that is known to make products which dont last, but they do work and they're worth the few dollars.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2023",AF5OUEFOZEFSX7RDULDC6MNRJDOQ,TRUE,1,Color: Lux Gray

Dunn,4,"I mean, let's just be honest here: It's a Bose. That alone tells you that the sound quality is going to be awesome, right? And it is.My story started with my wife's uncle and I walking through one of those big-box stores looking for something I could spend some Christmas cash on. We came to the section of Bluetooth speakers and he shows me the Bose that he has, the smaller version of this unit. It sounded great, of course, and was right where my price-point was as well. But I just HAD to go and listen to this unit. Once I did, I was hooked. I knew I had to have it!! So, we left the big box store, him with a portable speaker for traveling, and me with cash still in my pocket.We get home to Grandma's house and I have a conversation with my wife. These units were on sale at the time the big box store, and I looked to see if they were on Amazon as well, and they were! So after some coaxing, she agreed to let me order the bigger unit! It arrived quickly, as always (thanks Prime) and immediately the sounds of music were filling our house. We use it all the time! Outside BBQing, playing cornhole, doing yard work, sunbathing in the nude (colored bathing suits), as well as inside for all of the fun activities in the house too.You can't go wrong with this unit. My BIGGEST complaint with it is the Bluetooth sometimes loses connection with my iPhone 11Pro Max. It's annoying as hell when that happens, but I usually can get it reconnected within a few minutes, tops. This mostly happens if I've been using the Soundlink, step away (out of range) with my phone, and then come back in range again. Hopefully, a firmware update can get this corrected sometime soon.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2020",AFQ5VTKGKUXDFE65WPUUK2HFVD2A,TRUE,1,Color: Lux Gray

I returned the revolve plus, and kept the revolve because I thought $200 was already outrageous and $300 was well, bonkers. HOWEVER, after using the revolve for a few days, I began to miss the completeness of the revolve plus. So I returned the revolve and forked over the extra $100 for the revolve plus. And I never looked back.Let me just highlight how important it is that they‚Äôre able to design a case to emit sound equally across the room. It‚Äôs spectacularly a sound show that subtly captures your attention because it‚Äôs just so impressive.The bass is clean. The mid is excellent. And the treble is there but can be slightly increased.To enhance your listening experience, my advice is to either place it in the corner of your room to allow the sound waves to bounce around. I currently have it attached to my Roku to watch TV and/or listen to Spotify with.It‚Äôs one of those little speakers that demands big attention to whatever you‚Äôre watching or listening to, with a side of wonderment of how they packed so much power into something so little.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2021",AERESHXHNINSOSUYZA4AYS5A5JVA,TRUE,0,Color: Triple Black

He is in college and absolutely loved it. He used it to fill his living quarters with music and took it everywhere (frisbee golf, skateboarding, parties, etc...). When he came home for the summer he brought it home with him, but when he was packing to go back to college the speaker was nowhere to be found. He thought he had left it somewhere and we assumed someone had picked it up and we would never see it again. This was the second week in August, It is now the last week of April. I was outside jumping on our trampoline with my youngest son last night and saw something hanging off the frame that looked like a lantern, and after a closer look I discovered it was the Revolve! We live in Wisconsin, and the speaker and been out in the heat of the summer, below freezing temps of the winter, through severe rain storms, ice storms and lots of snow. I figured there was no way it was still going to work. We took it in the house and wiped it down with a wet cloth and it looked like new. Plugged it into a charger and the revolve happily announced that it was charging! Gave it a few minutes of charging and connected it to my phone through bluetooth and it sounded just as amazing as it did the 1st day and shows no weather wear, like new!! I let my son know I found it and he can't wait to get it back (he is 3 hrs away). I'm so happy I didn't sacrifice quality for a cheaper price tag!

It is a mono speaker, but it's the best sounding mono speaker I've ever heard. It sounds better than most stereo bluetooth speakers! The 360 degree sound is awesome and incredibly convenient; having to reposition the speaker to achieve ideal sound quality for listeners is a thing of the past. As others have pointed out, this is an expensive speaker. But, you get what you pay for in this case. Best three hundred bucks I've ever spent. It may sound stupid, but I love the handle due to the convenience factor. I just can't say enough good things about this speaker! If you're on the fence about purchasing this Bluetooth speaker due to the fact that it's mono and others may feature stereo, don't be. I was originally. The sound quality is top of the line. Bottom line: Excellent product and well worth the money.Update: I remember reading a review of this product a few days ago saying that the physical buttons will wear down after heavy use. I won't lie; it did give me hesitation. Well, for those of you who fear the same thing, fear not! I've discovered a way to play this without having to ever touch the buttons! You will need to download the app, however. To turn on the speaker, open the bose connect app. Then, it will show the speaker, asking to connect. Simply swipe down on the image and it will connect the speaker to your device and power it on. To turn it off, just enable to ""auto off"" feature on the app. To control the volume, sinply do it from the app. I hope this helps!","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2018",AGF33XIJG27URHBXUZBCBVGFM4PA,TRUE,11,Color: Lux Gray

I ordered this speaker and the first one never reached full charge despite me leaving it in the charger for 2 days. Replacement speaker had 30% charge upon opening so I never touched the charger. Anyway, so I wanted a speaker that would be loud enough for get together with 15+ people. Might not sound a lot but when you have that many people talking at the same time, it can overpower music. So volume definitely mattered, as does sound quality. Reviews on this speaker indicated it was great for both. But friends of mine had strongly recommended the Home pod, which is more expensive. I ended up buying both to compare the two. And wow, the home pod was amazing. I was shocked. It cost a little over a hundred dollars more but totally worth it. So if you‚Äôre able to, I‚Äôd definitely consider that speaker first. This one isn‚Äôt bad but once you try the HomePod, it‚Äôs a game chamber. Also, what I didn‚Äôt like about this speaker is that if I took my phone to the phone and speaker was playing music through it, I‚Äôd lose connection.

Get those two things right and -- yes -- you'll feel the bass and the mid tones are absolutely spectacular. Used properly -- it's possible to ""wow"" in a real way.To get the full stereo delivery you must use the Bose App. It' connects to a speaker and then automatically links to the other speaker to offer two modes. One mode is identical sound out of both speakers. The MAGIC comes when you switch it to Stereo Mode. I've used the app for months on the latest iPad Pro. Not one problem and it took less than three minutes to figure out.Speaker placement is a really, really big deal with these speakers. If it's resonating against something that works -- the bass can be mind blowing. If you stick it in the center of a table and play mediocre audio -- it may even seem to suck. Experiment on every surface from the floor to ceiling and you'll quickly understand.With the stereo mode through the Bose app and with proper speaker placement -- these can be, essentially, unbelievably good.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020",AECKHWCXQGLYTOXMCRYNGVS5BUFA,TRUE,3,Color: Triple Black

Who will win??,TheMan1990,5,"First unpaid/not free review! I was just about to but the Soundlink III when I refreshed and a link to the Revolve+ appeared and BAM! 20 hours later it's here.... I immediately tested it against my Soundlink mini II and here are my thoughts....Pros:1. Setup is your usual typical Bose easiness, took maybe two minutes.2. Rich bass and crisp sounds at all volume levels3. The mini has slight buzzy distortion at top 2-3 volume notches, this does not. Clear from 0-100.4. Definitely more ""room filling."" Put both of them in my mid house and cycled back and forth between them playing Tool's Third Eye (which pretty much encompasses the entire musical range of any song I know.) Side by side they were both nice with the R+ being a bit better. 20ft away the R+ blows the Mini II away. Muuuuuch clearer and deeper sound5. Looks good, light, unobtrusive and the long battery life will be greatCons:1. Party mode to connect two Bose speakers apparently will only work with other Revolves. Would NOT connect with the Mini 2. Shattered are my dreams of whole house noise....2. Could be a tad louder. Still much louder than the Mini 2 but as they say, if it's TOO loud, you're too old....3. You have to BUY a charging cradle?? Really, Bose?? Gonna nickel and dime us on a $300 Speaker?????4.

It always comes on in party mode first, and then you can flip it to stereo mode. You have to read the docs to figure it out. You aren't likely to discover how to do it by just looking at the controls and tinkering. You can set up stereo mode without the Bose Connect app, but I agree with the docs that it is easier to set up with the app.The speakers lose the connection between each other if you you stop playing music for a few minutes. They also loose the mode if you wanted stereo mode.Bose, please if you are reading: I want the Bose Connect app to save data to configure the second speaker with a single touch, and remember the stereo / party mode setting.

I wanted something I could pair my iMac to to get a little more sound definition than the built in speakers, but also could take with me to the beach, on my back patio, or to use anywhere else in my home too while I‚Äôm listening to music. Previously I used Brookstone‚Äôs Big Blue Party peaker, however it has been discontinued and the one I had been using for a few years stopped working.I sat the Bose Soundlink on my kitchen island and tested it out. At first I was actually disappointed in the sound quality from the Bose Soundlink plus in comparison to my big blue party. The big blue party was at least 3x the size and 5x the weight, but the sound quality was superior. Sharp highs, deep smooth bass. The bass from the Soundlink was underwhelming and both my partner and I thought the highs sounded muffled.I picked the Soundlink up and I noticed as I moved it closer to the wall the sound quality improved. So for now, I have it behind my iMac monitor and in between the wall where it can resonate off of both surfaces. The highs sound clearer this way and the bass resonates a little more. It‚Äôs important to note that this speaker sounds better the further away from it you are.I still wish it was a bigger speaker with louder bass. It‚Äôs quite small and light, but honestly it‚Äôs a speaker. It spends most of its time sat down on a surface. I think they should offer a larger model with better sound range for consumers like me who want to be able to move it around but don‚Äôt need to carry it around for long periods and don‚Äôt really need the small size and light weight.I will be keeping it as I am not sure of a better option currently on the market for me. But I am a little underwhelmed and I don‚Äôt think the sound quality of this speaker is up to Bose‚Äôs standards. At least not up close. I wish this would have been explained better in the description.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2019",AFG6LHOTV4MTK4EN5PNI5YDEZDYA,TRUE,3,Color: Lux Gray

This speaker has the best 360 degree sound you can find. The bass is terrific, crystal clear vocals and can get VERY loud.The top end loudness range is VERY good. This unit does not distort at all at any range. We mainly purchased this for outside patio music. No matter when you place the unit the quality sound is the same for anyone sitting in any position on the patio. Unlike other speakers we had this unit provides a true 360 degree experience. Other speakers we tried normally have a single direction of sound. This is ok if you are sitting directly in front of the unit but not the best way to get quality sound for everyone or every area.So currently we are using this inside (we live in a cold weather area) and use it everyday.

Nothing seamless about the connectivity.- Almost impossible to use the microphone unless you are half a foot away from the speaker, talking directly at it, and there is no background noise. You cannot use this to make phone calls for sure, since this happens all the time: I'm listening to some music with the speaker within 5 feet max. A call comes in, I'm taking the call, default setting is to keep the call on the speaker since I'm using it as audio output, the person calling me cannot hear me. I need to switch to the iPhone speaker. Why bother having a microphone?- The charging dock is poorly designed: it's hard to place the speaker correctly and because of this you end up dragging the dock across whatever surface it's on, and most often disconnect the dock.Overall for this price range I think it's really not worth it.

If you're looking for bombastic bass you should probably look for another product, but the bass is very good. You hear the entire range of the music, with none of them drowning at the others. The music fills a room because it projects in 360 degrees, as opposed to conventional speakers which only push sound forward. If you place this in the center of a room, the sound quality is the same in each part of the room. They sound quality is amazing considering this Bose is the size of a beer mug!The Bluetooth connectivity is very simple. The battery life claims to be up to 16 hours on a full charge, and this seems to be true based on my experience. Each time you power it on a voice tells you the status of your battery.

Judged on its own, the Soundlink Revolve+ is terrific. Judged against other bluetooth speakers, there's no comparison. Where other speakers regularly struggle with loud volume and bass, never once has that been a concern with the Soundlink Revolve+. When I first got it, I'd find myself cringing at parts of songs where past speakers had sounded blown out, but that's passed. Now I know I can rely on the speaker for supreme, high quality music.That said, Bose's software leaves something to be desired. When it works, it works great. When it doesn't, you'll wonder if it will ever work again. Connecting can be difficult. Setting up party mode often takes more than one try. And at one point for a few days, the speaker wasn't charging even though it said it was. Bose customer support put me on the right track to fixing that final issue. It was, blessedly, a software rather than a hardware issue. Same for the rest.

The portability is wonderful. But as others have reported the connection issues are extremely annoying..It turns itself on randomly and announces what it's connected to.. Someone could be in the living room using it and it will connect to your device in the next room as well causing two different sounds to play out of the speaker at the same time. When I ""turn off"" the speaker it will turn itself on every time it senses a Bluetooth connection it has saved.. So if I'm using it and a friend comes over it will just automatically connect them to it interrupting what you were listening to just to announce the device it connected to and then you have two devices battling over each other. Then a third person could come over and the same thing will happen all over again.You turn the speaker off cause your going to bed and then after you get into bed and surf your phone a little bit the speaker will randomly connect to your phone from the next room and announce the device causing you to either get up and turn the speaker off again just for it to happen as soon as you get back into bed or manually forget the speaker from the Bluetooth settings in your phone but then the speaker is just sitting on in the next room. At first the excellent sound quality and the ease of portability out weighs these problems but as time goes on and it happens so frequently it gets very tiresome.I'm glad I'm not the only one with these issues.I would still recommend though just cause I like having such a nice speaker wherever I go... Just beware.A little tip.. Turn the speaker to AUX before you turn it off and this helps with the random connections.","Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2019",AFEKXADFB7EW5YVAU23WGXBXYYZA,TRUE,27,Color: Lux Gray

No need it for to announce the connection, and I really wish it would automatically turn off if nothing has connected after like 30 secs instead of it endlessly saying ""READY TO CONNECT."" Also wish I could disable it from automatically turning on whenever I connect. It's fine when I turn on my PC but my wife's phone randomly activates it from time to time. Bose, get a handle on this (sorry sorry, bad pun.)These things are a tad annoying but not deal-breakers at all. Seriously, it sounds awesome.

Simply keep pressing the device button on the top of the speaker until it comes back to just your device and the volume will pop back up to normal.

The AIWA is much larger so Bose has that but most of the time, I use the AIWA because it sounds so dang awesome! If travel is important, the Bose is, without question, more practical. If quality and loud sound around the house and yard or at a picnic or something is important, then definitely check into the AIWA. To be clear, the Bose is very nice and does put out decent sound for such a small package and I do really like it. It's just that when it is used next to the AIWA and based on the quality of sound, the Bose really seems over priced. As far and buying the Bose again: I can't say whether or not I would buy it again but I probably would. I can throw it in a suitcase and go.

They were surprised when I showed them where they were hanging and how small they were. The DJ for the wedding reception said they were excellent quality and he uses larger Bose speakers for his setup. It was his first time listening to these and said he was planning on buying for his house and personal use.The price was $20 more than what I paid for my Bose SoundLink III and worth every dollar of it. You will need to use the Bose Connect App if you want to pair two of them together with Bluetooth connection. When you power them off, you do have use the App to pair them to your device again.Highly recommend this product!","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2017",AHBPWXTB6AIRGUWBI6ZRSXS5RUVQ,TRUE,219,Color: Triple Black

I bought them for audio assistance for on-the-road presentations, when the venue I was speaking at didn't have audio for my slides. I also just use them personally when on the patio or while traveling in the hotel room. This semester I am teaching a course on popular music, but was assigned a classroom without audio (frustrating to say the least). I bought this speaker to use to teach in a classroom of 55 students. While it's nothing compared to larger speakers designed specifically for a room, both me and the students are amazed at how loud and clear this speaker is for music examples in the classroom. It's just nothing short of amazing. This speaker is not ""subtle"" for careful listening, but it is a workhorse for me and seriously ingeniously designed for portability. It does sound amazing in smaller spaces, and the design makes it suitable for open air use (the Soundlink Mini sounded better when put up against a wall of some sort). Truly an exceptional speaker.","Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2017",AH2FZL2OGN5X7U66HCQ5UJ4FXH3A,TRUE,4,Color: Triple Black

It's the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I've ever heard and I'm very happy with my purchase, even though it was a bit spendy at $299.I was also blown away by the battery life.

Still, 3-4 hours was better than nothing. The sound quality was good, but not great. The JBL back-up BT sounded better and lasted longer and it was a year older... Go figure!!! And no, we didn't have the volume at MAX sound for the duration of playing. The same thing would happen when it's sitting on our counter in the kitchen.Perhaps the most annoying issue is the cable from the wall to the speaker. This darn thing takes an Act of God to get it to charge. This has been an issue from the beginning. You have to have the base situated in a certain position with the cable flexed the right way in order for it to charge. Definitely not what I'd expect from Bose on this front as well. Disappointing!!!Lastly, why does it want to connect to every darn device we have? It will randomly say ""Bose Connected"" and you're wondering why and to what...We've had this speaker for 2 years now. The first 3 months it was quality and then it just started going downhill.

I have Bose Computer speakers, soundbar, Soundlink Mini and so I went ahead and bought the Revolve. I really hate everything about the product. First off even when off you never can tell if the Bose Speaker is powered on or off as even when off the battery drains quickly. Strike 1. Strike 2, the Bose Downloaded Software is pure crap. Good luck figuring out how to use on a PC once installed. On a MAC no problem..but the software is junk and in intuitive. On a MAC you can at least soft of find your way through the SW but again the SW is clunky and tells you nothing. Ok so now my real gripe. The Soundlink Mini 2 worked great. It paired with my PC and streamed iTunes issue free. As did my UE Boom. So now the Revolve. Streaming to a Apple TV it seems to work and with Echo Dot it also seems to work if within a few feet of the DOT AND INDOORS. Move it our doors and nothing. Side by side to the Boom no issue. Meaning Boom has no issue and the Revolve craps out. Literally 15 feet from the Dot but outside, the Revolve is worthless and will not work properly. The sound is fine but it is the BT connection, stack, or FW which is crap and unfortunately there is no new SW to download. Play any song and your parts before the music fades out then back in and so on..repeatedly. Today I bought the Soundlink Mini Color and saw about the same performance and immediately returned it. So in a nutshell, the sound quality is great...but the spekaer has serious BT streaming issues that are not seen on competitor devices. Now my PC is brand new, my Echo is now the Echo Studio and my MACBook Pro are all new, but all have issues with the BOSE that do not happen with competitor speaker. My Revolve has now been sent back to Bose for repair. The unit is 7 months old and has less that 3 hours of play time on it because it has never worked. This buyer is moving past Bose as candidly it is over rated and not worth the price for crap SW, BT connectivity a,d service. BTW, today I had three Bose speakers side by side streaming to my new PC playing iTunes. The older Soundlink Mini no issue at all. Played every song with zero issues. But the Revolve and Soundlink Color had nothing but issues with fading streaming song after song. UE boom like the Soundlink Mini..no issue. A $300 speaker with only a few hours of play time should not have to be sent back to the OEM for service.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2019",AHCNK5RZYZ2AKGBJPF4MOGG4IYLQ,TRUE,13,Color: Triple Black

I went to a big box store to do a few listening tests and found myself drawn to the Revolve, Revolve +, and the JDL extreme 2. After spending literally 30 minutes rotating between all three, I ommitted the JDL. It's a good speaker, lots of nice bass, but the Bose Revolves just sounded more balanced along with good bass as well. I didn't purchase then because I wanted to spend a day or so on reviews, research, etc. Finally, I pulled the trigger on this one.This thing is awesome, and I couldn't be happier. Whether jamming when doing something mindless on the PC or listening to something relaxing when concentrating, this thing is pure listening pleasure.

The bass is richer, and the few inches of extra height improves mid and high end sound distribution when the device sits by the firs pit or poolside.Someone needs to market an accessory that weighs a substantial amount on purpose, and it needs to be black and look great and attaches to the bottom of the speakerFor the regular person who cares about the balance between weight and sound for mobile devices, this currently is absolutely the best.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2019",AH6QMYLBS7IOLCD4SKVLV6KAKCDA,TRUE,1,Color: Triple Black

Easily beats the B&O A1 that I'd tried before on usability (the A1 has terrible buttons), sound quality, volume, and fit&finish.As with the QC 35s, Bose has done a good job with their bluetooth implementation, the connection is solid and being able to pair to two devices simultaneously is fantastic. Auto power-off on signal loss is also a nice touch, and the voice announcements of connections and battery level is well implemented.The charging base works well and makes it quick to keep the speaker topped up, although it would be great if the speaker keyed itself into the correct rotational orientation better (or better yet, if the orientation didn't matter). It's a bit of a puzzle to get one relatively featureless cylinder lined up with another by feel alone.The only significant change I'd request of Bose is to have used a USB-C charge port instead of microUSB, which by 2017 should have been deprecated for new designs.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2017",AG6KDH5BRLK5RZ63IUY4MHDGMF5Q,TRUE,1,Color: Lux Gray

Amazon didn't even wait for the returned product to arrive at their warehouse before shipping out a replacement. This is called customer service.Bose products are great - everyone knows that but this little thing can get pretty loud at full volume. Not your typical Bluetooth speaker. It packs a punch. Even at high volumes there is no distortion in music. You should not expect a subwoofer bass out of this thing. I see some unreal expectations for a product of this size and category in some comments. I will tell you though from every other bluetooth speaker that I have heard this has the best bass of all.Note: For normal use, there is absolutely no need to buy the charging cradle.

Sound was good, bass was mediocre but it didn't get very loud. The Revolve+ has great battery life however. Not to mention the $299 price point - unfortunately my expectations were not met.Soon after I stumbled upon the Bose Portable Home Speaker, just released in Sept of 2019. It was only $50 more than the Revolve+ so I picked one up. The difference was immediate and clear - this was the sound I was looking for! Compared to the Bose Portable Home Speaker, the Revolve+ bass is almost nonexistent.I believe Bose crammed an additional passive radiator into this speaker, for a total of three whereas the Revolve+ only has two. The difference is substantial. Needless to say I returned the Revolve+ and couldn't be happier with the BPH.My main complaint is the inability to have 2 devices paired up simultaneously. The speaker is advertised with this capability, yet whoever wants to pair up needs to have the Bose Music app installed on their phone, and even then, one of the devices is getting disconnected/booted before the other one can play. It's not very intuitive, however I feel an update could easily solve this issue.Secondly, there's no Google Play support as of yet. I find this mind boggling considering Spotify, Prime Music, Pandora, iHeart, Deezer, TuneIn and Sirius are all supported! Please Bose, tighten up and add Google Play support ASAP.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2020",AF5F3QSY3PI6QJEADUY5DAGQTH7A,TRUE,4,Color: Triple Black

Cook,2,"I love the simplistic design. Although this is larger than the Revolve, it is still very manageable and does not take up a lot of space. Very good sound quality, but I think the 360 sound dynamics will take a bit of adjusting to. It is very cool to be able to walk around the room with consistent sound. This would be perfect if the price point was where the Revolve was. From other reviews, it doesn't seem like the extra $100 has much bang for your buck. The set up was perhaps the easiest product set up that I have experienced. Overall, the product seems very durable.Update 12/22/2021 -I have owned this Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for roughly 3 years. My original review was a 4 star rating. After owning this device for longer, I am revising this to a 2 star. One star for the hardware quality. It still looks and feels durable and new. The other star is for sound quality. I think this does a fairly good job of filling up a space with clear sound.After repeated and prolongued use, I have found this to be so annoying that I need to rescind my original recommendation. Every single time you turn this device on, a LOUD and robotic female voice announces ""BATTERY X%!!!! CONNECTED TO *DEVICE NAME*!!!!"" Battery 80%!!!! Connected to Macbook Pro!!!! Every time. As a stand alone defect, this would be annoying; however, this device automatically powers off after a certain amount of time, let's say about 10-15 minutes if no audio is running. So if you turn it on, and endure this obnoxious announcement, and leave the room and come back it will be disconnected and you have to turn it on and listen to the obnoxious announcement again. It's really terrible as a night owl with their laptop connected. If it is late and you're trying to remain somewhat quiet to not disturb other people, you will have to constantly turn this device on and it will repeatedly announce that it is connected to your device. So if you want to watch a tv show with a volume level of let's say ""3"", you will have a level ""6"" sound immediately with the announcement. I really don't understand why this feature would be built in at all, or not have had a software update to remove it or make it optional. Incredibly bad choice by Bose. I think the original charging wire is really cheaply made. While connected to the micro usb, my Bose tipped over and in the process completely destroyed the connector of the micro USB. I am not sure why you would choose such a small, delicate little connector to plug in to a relativey bulky, heavy object. There have been instances where the Bose struggles to connect or detect my devices. Sometimes it won't, sometimes it will show that it is connected but the sound does not play through the speakers.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2017",AEKKWCG6CQBTGRZAP3NCMZOZECSA,TRUE,1,Color: Triple Black

Using the BOSE app, I added the three speakers (very easy process). I went to ""GROUP"" them and was limited to two speakers at a time. First of all, two is not synonymous with group. Two is a pair; three or more is a group. Two months later, I had the 500 and 300 grouped. Because I was going outside, I wanted to add the Portable Home Speaker. I ""added"" it before removing one of the two from the group, and, without explanation, the three grouped and now all three play simultaneously. I'm assuming there was an update to the software, which is great. However, I needed to connect six speakers (the three BOSE and three Harmon Kardons), so I tried using Google Home, which is outstanding with ""groups."" As I began the process as explained through Google's site, I came across the: CONNECT ANY SPEAKER, EXCEPT BOSE SPEAKERS WITH GOOGLE ASSIST. So now, once again, a tech issue that sets BOSE to the back of the line in the ""best speakers"" category. I have one final work-around that I'm hoping will work: connect the BOSE speakers to Smart Life outlets and hope that the app can ""override"" whatever barricades are preventing them from ""playing well with others."" Bottom line: if you're OK with grouping the specific BOSE speakers that work with the app (oh, yeah, by the way, not ALL Bose speakers work with the app), then they are great. However, if you're looking for the versatility that we've come to expect from Bluetooth, WiFi, and Smart technology, then look elsewhere. This is a road that BOSE has yet to pave. I will most likely sell the three BOSE and replace them with Harmon Kardons that will connect flawlessly and play simultaneously with all other speakers. If my work-around with the Smart Life outlet works, I will post an update for anyone else who wants to group various speakers to play simultaneously. However, even if using a Smart outlet is a success, my rating and disappointment with these speakers will not change.

Expect good treble and bass, but average mid-range tones. Good for bass-heavy genres like hip hop, EDM and rock.

I use the speaker inside in every room of my house and outdoors too. The battery life is great. The sound quality is fabulous - exactly what you would expect from Bose. I got it to replace my old computer speakers which had a separate sub woofer. This little guy may not be as loud as powered speakers but it is plenty loud enough. Just beware that is a Bluetooth speaker not Wi-Fi thus when watching videos the sound won't sync perfectly with the video portion as there is a slight lag.

I am not even sure how this is possible, but this is a lag.2nd issue, this is an audio lag when you stream music via bluetooth on your laptop. Music or shows. This used to happen with the older Soundlinks, but the new soundlink mini and Soundtouch did not have this issue at all. So why is this issue present with the newest Soundlink Revolve?3rd issue, the Bose connect app, and instructions says that the device can be connected to two bluetooth at the same time. Yet, if it is connected to two devices, and I am streaming music from one device, the BT drops out after a minute. This does not happen if I disconnected one device, and only allow for one BT connection. That means it does NOT support two BT connections at the same time. I did update the software, but it made no differenceI really wanted to like this speaker. The sound and bass is amazing, much better than Riva. However, these BT/connection issues with the lag time need to be resolved before I will consider keeping this. In the time of so many decently priced BT speakers with no lag time like the Riva T, or even the soundlink mini, it is very disappointing for this speaker to have such issues. Maybe I received a dud, but I am returning this one and waiting for a few months to buy a new one again by which time I am hoping Bose will fix these issues.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2017",AGY53CHCJBZRIKOPJ2SQLRN4ZSVA,TRUE,44,Color: Lux Gray

From its compact design to its rich sound quality, this speaker exceeded my expectations in almost every aspect.First and foremost, let's talk about sound quality. Despite its small size, the Motion 300 delivers surprisingly powerful and clear audio. The dual 10W drivers and bass port produce crisp highs, well-defined mids, and surprisingly deep lows. Whether I was listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the sound reproduction was consistently impressive. Plus, with the BassUp technology, the bass response is enhanced, adding a nice punch to the low-end frequencies without sacrificing clarity.The portability of the Motion 300 is another highlight. Its compact and lightweight design makes it easy to take with me on the go, whether I'm traveling, hiking, or simply lounging in the backyard. The built-in handle is a convenient touch, allowing for easy carrying from place to place.Battery life is also commendable. With up to 12 hours of playtime on a single charge, I never had to worry about the speaker running out of juice during extended listening sessions. The quick charging feature is a nice bonus, providing hours of playback with just a short charging time.In terms of connectivity, the Motion 300 offers a variety of options. Bluetooth pairing is seamless and reliable, allowing me to connect my devices with ease. I also appreciate the inclusion of an AUX input for wired connections, as well as a microSD card slot for playing music directly from a memory card.The only minor downside I encountered was the lack of water resistance. While the Motion 300 is not advertised as being waterproof, it would have been nice to have some degree of water resistance for added peace of mind, especially for outdoor use.Overall, the Soundcore Motion 300 speaker delivers impressive sound quality, portability, and battery life at an affordable price point. Whether you're looking for a speaker to use at home, on the go, or during outdoor adventures, this speaker is definitely worth considering.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2024",AFOYRMOKICJUOYCQ3G6P5I2YNBTQ,TRUE,12,Color: green

This little guy self-adjusts an EQ according to which way the speaker is situated (flat, standing, or hanging) to provide an optimum listening experience. Not only that, there's an app that goes along with it that comes in handy for those that like to tweak things under the hood. For example, you can set and save the EQ for each of the three positions - and compare their defaults (which are PRETTY GOOD!) to your own taste and your own spaces. For the price and portability, this bluetooth speaker gets a full 5 STARS from me. Cons: No aux audio input. Wish it came with a charging block - only comes with a C-to-C cable. GREAT JOB SOUNDCORE - I'll be highly recommending your products to all my audiophile buddies.Comparison: I've been using a JBL Charge 4 for about six years now as an outdoor speaker, inside classrooms as a music teacher, and for meditation. It's been an extremely helpful and portable solution with big sound when you need it while not sacrificing quality and balance when played at low volume. I used to think JBL nailed it with the right amount of bass - but after spending a couple of weeks with Soundcore Motion 300, I want to try them all! Very impressed with how they dealt with the problems that come with directional speakers in open outdoor spaces.

It's solid in the hands and sounds very good with two Tweeter speakers. Even though I will save with most smaller Bluetooth speakers, that buying two and putting them together in True Wireless Stereo (TWS) mode is where they really shine.This speaker has a very good solid Construction it seems to be made of a single piece of plastic covered in a rubberized skin with a metallic front grill. It is somewhat heavy, but that is to be expected given the battery and the rest of the components inside. The speaker will NOT float in spite of being water resistant. In Black the rubberized covering has a blue speckled look. Each pattern is unique, which makes it very easy to identify which speaker is which in true Wireless modeIt's quite easy to pair and the buttons are useful and are easy to press with the exception of the bass boost button. The bass boost feature for me seems the least useful part of the speaker. If you want to have the most bass of the speaker can provide, it's better to set an equalizer in the app.The sound core app for the speaker is excellent. It provides control playback control, firmware updates, the ability to switch to LDAC (requires a firmware update), and of course the customizable equalizer that I mentioned. You can save different equalizer settings, and can also scan QR codes that others have shared that will provide their EQ settings. Very cool.The sound is quite good in this speaker. It does have two separate Tweeter speakers along with the passive bass radiator. The having two speakers does provide some very small stereo separation, but if you want good stereo separation, it's better to purchase two of these and pair them together getting True Wireless Stereo. For those who may not know, true wireless stereo means that one speaker plays the Left Channel the other speaker plays the right channel. This pairing does preserve after power off: when you power both back on again they will reconnect to the previous device , remembering that they were connected via true wireless stereo.Well I don't like with Soundcore's very aggressive marketing to YouTubers willing to shill for their products, I do agree that the speaker is a great piece of kit and a good quality product. Highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AGVJPFT35DQ7TKPEZ5SYZA2O5YDA,TRUE,16,Color: black

We actually purchased another Doss of the same model, but they must have changed some of the internals because the new Doss sounded like it was stuffed in a pillow. It went right back! We purchased a Bose SoundLink Flex which was comparable in size to our old speaker. The Bose had phenomenal volume and bass for the size, but sounded flat on top end to me. The Bose also reproduced sound in mono. I didn‚Äôt think that would be a big deal with the small size, but perhaps I was wrong. I don‚Äôt know if it was the lack of high end, the mono sound, or a mix of the two, but I couldn‚Äôt stand the sound from the Bose, and it had to go back. Now back in the market for another Bluetooth speaker, I knew I wanted something comparable in size to the Bose and our old speaker, but that had the capability to customize the sound and broadcast in stereo. This speaker fit the bill. Comparing this speaker side by side to the Bose, the Bose has a slight advantage to my ears in terms of raw volume and bass. If I didn‚Äôt have them side by side however, I don‚Äôt think I would ever notice. Both were clearly better than our old speaker. No side by side was needed for that. After downloading the SoundLink app, customizing the sound to my liking was very simple. I was able to crank the high end where I couldn‚Äôt on the Bose. I was able to hear those cymbals and screaming guitar solo in rock music like you should in person. I can hear the high registers on violins and flutes in classical music like you should. I‚Äôm sure audiophiles will scoff at me, but I like to hear music the way I like to hear it. This speaker let me do just that. The ‚ÄúBassUp‚Äù feature in my opinion is just kind of a gimmick. From what I can tell, all it does is pull down the highs. Again, this speaker has a equalizer on the app to adjust everything the way you want anyway. Placing the speaker in a corner or right in front of a wall gives more felt bass in my experience. The battery makes it at high volume for an entire evening‚Äôs campfire, so that works for me. I‚Äôm sure it would make an 8-10 hour day at a reasonable volume. The exterior felt more high end on the Bose, but this speaker is not bad at all. Both feel much more luxurious than our old Doss. It is noticeably heavier than our old speaker and the Bose if that matters to you. That being said, none of them feel like you are carrying a lead bar. The sound that comes from all speakers this size and weight absolutely amazes me! The slim shape makes it really easy to slip in a big pocket or bag or just carry. The build feels very solid all around. I haven‚Äôt dropped it yet, but if it‚Äôs anything like our old speaker, I am sure it would survive all but the worst falls. I‚Äôve had no problem with Bluetooth connectivity, and it is quick to connect. At this point, I have no real complaints in sound or functionality. I think we found a keeper.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023",AFPZ6VOWK6MGYFCSOSHSR2L2S3WA,TRUE,12,Color: black

I accidentally purchased this thinking it was a Bose speaker. I was very impressed with how it sounded and was even more impressed with the ease of pairing at. It charged very easily. The charge lasts over several months so far (I don't use it every day). I thought that those finally got this right. I have had Bose portable speakers in two areas of my house. They take forever to charge and the charging port never works on the first try. Sometimes I have to wiggle the wire and sometimes use another cable to get it to charge. The speakers are good but dialogue and words on songs are muffled. So I thought that Bose finally got it right. A speaker that sounds beautiful, holds a charge forever, and appears easily and charges easily. Then I realize that the little letter that I thought was up be on the front of the speaker signifying Bose is not a B, but capital S for sound core! I have been astounded. I bought a less expensive version to put in the bathroom where I had a Bose speaker and it sounds many times better. It is waterproof so I don't have to worry about the accumulated moisture of it being in a bathroom. I'm considering getting one of the more expensive sound course speakers to put in my living room. Can't recommend these highly enough. I've only had them several months but so far they are completely reliable and a joy to listen to. I never thought I would say that I would go with another brand of speakers. While I'm eating my words and I am a sound core guy now. How they put this much sound in such a small speaker for such a reasonable price and have the rest of the features operate flawlessly is a mystery to me and a credit to this company. I also enjoy the base boost button. I keep it on as it creates a great balance of sound and gives it a little more punch but not at all in a way that distorts the sound. I also like that I have been able to listen to podcasts and the moderators voice is clear and crisp (it was muffled on the Bose), and then switch to a range of music and have it sound very complete and enjoyable. Have recommended it to several friends. I think you will enjoy this speaker from your ears to your pocketbook. The look and feel of the speaker is also high quality.

Standing up, laying down and hanging up on the attachment on the side of the speaker.You'll notice the sound changes when you position the speaker in one of the 3 positions I mentioned above. The speaker is designed that way to change with the position you desire. That's the smart tune feature that Soundcore built to enhance the listening experience. I personally enjoy the speaker standing up. However, on its back, the smart tune feature switches to a 360 degree mode that has a wider range.The bass up feature I believe is not perfected, because it drowns out the clarity and treble and takes away the balanced sound.The LDAC feature is not as strong as larger speakers and enhances the sound marginally. I wouldn't use the feature because it puts a strain on the battery time.Soundcore promises 13 hrs battery life and at 50 percent volume you'll get 11.50. Higher volumes will get you less battery life.I would highly recommend the Motion 300. In fact, buy two and pair them. The stereo Soundstage is incredible and can fill a large room at 60 Watts between the two speakers.Soundcore has done it again with another stellar product that can compete with the big boys like Sony or JBL.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AHTFE4GQI2J2FZLNFBRTCAMMQGDQ,TRUE,16,Color: black

I approached the purchase of the Soundcore Motion 300 with some hesitation, expecting it to be just another budget speaker. However, after using it for a while, I can confidently say I was positively surprised by both the sound and build quality of this product.Having used a number of Bose, Sony, and JBL products over the years, I have high expectations for sound quality and durability. My daily go-to has been the Bose SoundLink Mini, which has set a pretty high standard for me. Shockingly, the Motion 300 holds up remarkably well in comparison, delivering a sound experience that‚Äôs incredibly similar to the Bose SoundLink Mini, yet at a fraction of the cost.I‚Äôm not into blasting loud music‚Äîmost of my listening involves piano, soft music and talks, and this speaker delivers exceptionally well for that. The first thing that struck me was how rich and natural the sound is for a speaker at this price point. The bass is deep but doesn‚Äôt overpower the mids and highs, which remain crisp and well-defined.While Bose speakers tend to have a signature warm sound, the Soundcore's audio profile is a bit more neutral, which I appreciate because it offers more versatility across different types of content. The speaker‚Äôs ability to maintain clarity at low volumes was another pleasant surprise. It doesn‚Äôt distort when you increase the volume either, which is crucial if you plan to use it for gatherings or in larger spaces.If you're looking for a high-quality Bluetooth speaker but don‚Äôt want to break the bank, the Soundcore Motion 300 is a fantastic option. For a fraction of the price of premium brands, you get comparable sound quality with a well-rounded balance of bass, mids, and highs. Whether you're using it for music, podcasts, or social gatherings, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2024",AELP7RVFRKWHJZW7OULHLTHTSBCQ,TRUE,0,Color: black

The 30 watts of stereo sound easily fills my small apartment, and the music remains undistorted. Plus I can use it for hours before charging. There are a lot of other great features included, like the Smart-Tune Technology, so when I found my baby blue Motion 300 on sale for way under $100, I bought it.I highly recommend Anker Soundcore in general and the Soundcore Motion 300 bluetooth speaker in particular.

This speaker did not disappoint me. Out of the box, the Soundcore Signature EQ is too bright and can sound quite harsh with modern music, but the Balanced EQ takes the edge off and gives it a more pleasing, neutral sound. It really sounds good. I've AB'd it with some low-end studio monitors and its surprisingly close.A speaker this size is not going to produce a lot of bass, the laws of physics prevent that. But there is decent bass presence when listening indoors. It's not like computer speakers with zero bass. On the other hand, the smaller size and unique shape makes it easy to pack for travel.One thing that really separates it from its peers is its clarity in the midrange. A lot of other speakers scoop out the midrange and sound hollow. This sounds much more natural. The stereo drivers help make the sound more open as well.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2024",AGT2GLYXMYGHHE2G7JOCEIXSK5VA,TRUE,2,Color: blue

However, this always happens automatically and you can‚Äôt actually disconnect these devices once they are paired. So if someone who previously connected to your speaker turns on Bluetooth and plays some audio, it‚Äôll just override what you‚Äôre playing. It‚Äôs can be useful in some cases, but can be a real pain as the only solution is to find the person and tell them to disconnect their device.

I love that I can turn off the device from the app - for those cases where I don't want to walk across the room to turn it off.My one gripe with this product is its media controls. Standard controls: play/pause, and volume up/down work relatively fine. However, skipping ahead or behind is a pain, requiring a double and triple tap of the play/pause button respectively. As if this weren't an issue on its own, pausing or playing music has a VERY significant lag because it's trying to determine if you're playing/pausing or skipping tracks.There are no controls in the app to remedy this, so I've just resorted to only touching the device when I need to turn it on - all other controls happen on my phone.If this can be fixed, or the standard controls (previous track is a long press of the volume down, and the same for next track on volume up) can be presented as an alternative, it would be super helpful.That aside, the product itself works and sounds great. Battery life is pretty good - nothing earth-shattering, but it lasts more than 10 hours at medium volume.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AGDWOS2FXYIP7SQAULV3F3VK5NVA,TRUE,0,Color: black

Using it with an Android phone and a PC, both with LDAC support. Impressed, considering this is a relatively small portable speaker. The difference between this and my Earfun Uboom when listening to music is noticeable when listening to LDAC files and after customizing the equalizer in the Soundcore app. Separation and clarity of different instruments apparent in the 300 and largely missing in the Uboom. The Uboom is a very good portable speaker, but the 300 is at a higher level because of LDAC. Without LDAC, I prefer the Uboom because it has a more vibrant sound to my ear. Navigating the Motion 300 controls and app is a breeze. Like the sound in the different orientations. Using as a desk speaker while plugged in to a USB power hub, so no need to test the battery.I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could because of the relative ordinariness of the non-LDAC sound, but erred on the side of 5 stars because of the rarity of LDAC support in portable speakers right now.

Additionally, and this was surprising-the build-in microphone allows me to use it to test the speech-recognition software my company develops. That's how good the mic is. Oh, right, it is a speaker. Now, given that there is internal protection from water, etc, the sound is excellent, in comparison. Controls are bright and easily visible, and blue-tooth connection signaling is an excellent idea, missing in other devices.

Soundcore by Anker has knocked it out of the park with this speaker, and I simply couldn't be happier. While this is more than I planned to spend on a Bluetooth speaker, it was well worth the investment as I can already tell this build quality will last a very long time.Connecting the speaker to my phone couldn't have been easier. It paired instantly and even renamed the device automatically so I can easily recognize the in the future. It does have an app you can download for more control over some settings, but it's not necessary.The Bluetooth range is impeccable. I cranked the volume up to max and walked ~150ft away before I hear the first break in connection. Speaking of volume, this speaker performs better than any other mobile speaker I've used before. While I didn't notice anything remarkable about the Bass Boost mode, it has a decent, well rounded audio profile already.I love the included loop that unsnaps to easily hang the speaker. While it's a little tough to unsnap it, the quality of the loop once again feels solid and that it will last a lot of use. Between the loop and the multiple arrangements of feet, this speaker is quite versatile in how you can orient it. The speaker will also automatically adjust it's sound profile depending on it's orientation. While I can I hear the adjustments being made when moving the speaker, I can't quite tell what impact it has on the audio quality. It might be more gimmick than anything, but I'm no audiophile and it's certainly not hurting anything.I love that the device uses USB-C to charge. This gives it faster charging capabilities over the older form factors, and I've already got plenty of these cables available (and the product includes a short cable as well).Overall, I feel this speaker is the best bang for the buck, easily justifying it's higher price point.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AGLRRYKJBJWL7YCTL25F3YECG2KA,TRUE,4,Color: black

I also found it lacking compared to the soundcore motion +, but that comes in a bigger package and is less portable.This speaker is fantastic for it's size, you have to realize your compromising the audio quality for that a little bit. While my mp3s didn't sound very good on it, lossless audio sounds absolutely fantastic. The vocals and instruments sound absolutely phenomenal, dare I say better than the x600. The piano and drum sounds felt so alive! I was really blown away. I found the sub-bass very lacking, with bass boosted on everything is drowned out, unlike the soundcore x600 which I think sounds pretty balanced with the bass boost (I'm a bass head though) If you are more interested in watching TV or media with this, this might be the speaker for you (if the battery life is good enough, need to test more for that.) I love the little strap, the test of time will see how rugged that is, but that was the main selling point for me. I tugged pretty hard on it and it didn't break, hopefully it has metal under the plastic. It's light (enough) and fits on a backpack from stock.Had to take a star off for the lack of an aux port, it deserves 3 stars for that, but for my uses I won't really be needing it. That being said I can't support such a backwards decision in anyway. Also, Anker has the worst aux ports I've ever used. My motion + aux port broke until I reset the software (....what?), My soundcore x600 aux port would cut out making PC use impossible without Bluetooth. So while I don't support the removal instead of improval, I could relate to an excuse they would make.Overall I don't regret this purchase and I love this portable speaker. If you don't plan on traveling with the speaker a lot and portability isn't key, I would recommend the soundcore x600, the mini upward firing speaker similar to Dolby Atmos is amazing, really let's the base shine without drowning out highs and mids.The soundcore motion plus is the best all around speaker from soundcore, which was very well designed and stands the test of time (the battery is a joke though, they could have doubled or even quadrupled the battery life while only making the speaker a little bit bigger.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2024",AGNYSNGOIHCBTUVP4IJWUF6HNLEQ,TRUE,1,Color: green

These were a thoroughly researched upgrade from a pair of TriBit Stormbox Micro 1.0, which sounded very good and were more portable but ultimately not powerful (loud enough) for my usage plan. These 300‚Äôs are PERFECT for my specific needs, recognizing that there are bigger/better Bluetooth speakers on the market. I also think if you can snare them @$65 you‚Äôre getting an excellent value.PLEASE NOTE: I am raving about using 2 at the same time to create a portable stereo sound field. If you want just 1 portable/personal, potentially wearable Bluetooth speaker, you might want something else. The TriBit Micro 2.0 maybe, or a UE Boom series.For me these are perfect because, while each is heavy ish (solidly built), the pair is small enough and not too heavy for me to throw in a backpack. There are bigger more powerful portable speakers but I decided these were the biggest I could realistically fit in a backpack (with my other stuff) and carry as a pair.Making the extra effort to carry 2 and create a stereo sound field is, for me, the difference between a shitty one speaker AM radio and a pretty decent car stereo set up.The bass won‚Äôt send shockwaves thru your body and I can imagine wanting more volume, but when these are paired up they create a very good, clear sounding, balanced soundstage providing adequate volume for good sized wide open outdoor spaces. Personally, full volume is just a tad too much for my needs.Highly recommended.

The clarity and bass presence is quite impressive. This speaker packs some punch especially for size. It's not exceptionally large, but is definitely bigger than my previous Wonderboom. It does fit in my backpack and is always with me along with a pair of over ear Soundcore headphones. I'm a sound engineer and Producer/Musician and have an obsession with sound and audio quality.I find the feature of the accelerometer and adjusted EQ a great asset. I hang this up on my cabinet while taking a shower and it fills the room with sound. Flat and speakers facing up the clarity is unsurpassed. Standing is not my favorite setting but I think I need to adjust the EQ more. Adjusting EQ to your taste is quite easy.One of the things I truly like about Soundcore is the ability to customize their higher end audio products. This speaker sounds so great my coworker asked what I was using and bought this speaker literally while talking to me. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth speaker that sounded more Hi-Fi and professional.It's quite rugged, I have 2 small children and they tend to run off with my things. This speaker has held it's own.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2024",AFRVRBH22GEXP56GPEUNFSMWYXZQ,TRUE,2,Color: black

So I escalated my support request, talked to a supervisor, and got the issue resolved. The supervisor was VERY helpful, apologized for the inconvenience, and over-nighted me a replacement! I've been using the new speaker for about a week and so far, so good. It's a weighty thing though - be warned! Great sound quality for the price point, and so far pretty decent battery life. Haven't tested the IP67 rating yet. But it's heavy! Don't expect to throw it in your pack and forget it's there. Overall, satisfied with the replacement speaker. Oh, one more thing - the Soundcore app is very simple.

The issue was finding something worth its price, while also being portable and powerful. The Bose was tough competition for sure, but the price tag steered me away quick - $150 (at the time of writing this). Enter the Anker Soundcore 300 - $68 (at the time of writing this). Comparable in size, weight, and design. The Anker however, better in sound. Turn on BassUp mode and it shadows the Bose.Off the bat you notice the attention they put into this. Premium feel. The Anker is ever so slightly bigger, and ever so slightly heavier (but in my opinion it's not noticeable).The Bose powers on with one click, the Anker you have to hold for a few seconds like traditional portable Bluetooth speakers. Both speakers have adaptive EQ adjustment depending on orientation (laying down, upright, etc).While Bose doesn't publicly state their wattage, I believe it's equipped with 20w. The Anker is equipped with 30w speakers. The Bose is no slouch by any means but a side by side comparison, the 30w makes a difference in deeper and clearer sound. That's without BassUp mode turned on.The Anker also has a slightly better waterproof rating at IPX7 vs Bose with IP67.The Anker also claims 13hrs of play time vs Bose with 12hrs. Also Bluetooth v5.3 vs Bluetooth v4.2. Also the Anker has a detachable (just as rugged) strap vs the Bose having a fixed one.Keep in mind the years these released - SoundLink Flex Oct 2021, SoundCore 300 Oct 2023.All in all I got everything I was looking for. Couldn't recommend the SoundCore 300 enough, and for $68 (vs $150) it's a steal with everything you get.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024",AEABL7T37MKXTSUCB5ZJ7U2NLFOQ,TRUE,23,Color: black

It's not a single speaker to blast a party... but in a house even a larger open area, it is more than enough and very clear at upper volumes.for the less than 1% of reviews that may say something negative, I have to assume they don't make many attempts to clear up the EQ or whatever. or maybe they got a dud, that happens in every product in the world. I literally turned it on, connected to phone via Bluetooth, opened Spotify and hit play... I do use the Spotify EQ, and so should you.Amazing sound from this small size. It can get loud and stay very clear to hear all the instruments and vocals, with the lows coming through and the highs not fading at all. Seriously bada** little speaker. Feels very solid and well made. Good weight to it also. Not sure how much better the double priced Bose model can be... this thing is more than good enough. The YouTube reviews will help you understand this thing is an amazing value without really compromising sound quality. The Anker brand is a very well established brand. Is it Bose? No. Bose is the best. Do I want to own two for the price of 1 and pretty much get the same thing? Yes please.Easy to carry and transport and great battery life.Really like the aesthetics. We bought the blue and green ones..., they were on discount vs the black. But both colors are understated and ""cool"".

Mid Bass, Not Obnoxious",Tim C,5,"I got this speaker in preview and have had a chance to test it out. I am happy with the fidelity and Crisp clear sound. Battery life seems great. Its not a big device hence it's not a Bass Boss, but I was also told that it's not Obnoxious because of this, and all around listened and enjoyed it and did not complain. I wouldn't say this is the best speaker for Hip Hop, but for highs and mids and small lows it is great. The music sound is great in my opinion, it's main feat is portability and battery life. I would say this is great for the bar, golf course or swimming pool and even camping. The only complaint, which is not even a complaint but maybe a wish, is that I cannot charge my phone off of it. It would be nice if traveling to use it as a battery bank if need be, given Anker is the Daddy of soundcore that's seems possible. But otherwise I can't recommend it enough to anyone that would like a high quality compact speaker for on the go o even around the house. If you want more mega bass, I would suggest soundcores other larger offerings. The 3d audio definitely has something going on. In my group of people I demoed for, we all thought best sound to was achieved in the flat up firing position. Look out AMI Juke box, I think we all saved money when I brought it in the bar to play songs. I have a recommendation from two bartenders that told me it was nice and wasn't so booming that it was a cop caller, but sounds great. I even had someone tell me they didn't even know the sound was coming from the soundcore, they thought it would as the Juke Box.

The bass boost actually enhances the bass line. I'm hearing notes and words I've never heard before even on my home Wi-Fi! My only knock is the charging cable...or lack of. Yes, there is a USB-c to USB-c cable. But there was no block to plug it in to. Now I have to spend more for a gadget that should have been included in the total package.

Overall I prefer my jbl flip 6 the most due to its bass output even if it is just mono. The bose soundlink flex also has better bass, but anemic mids and okay highs from its mono speaker make it my least favorite. The tribit maxsound plus I would say is just a step below the 300 with slightly better bass.All in all it's a great little speaker that comes with the best eq and app of any bluetooth speaker brand so you can fine tune it to your preference.

[Headphones were just not the best solution]. And for that use its great. Audio is good and in sync with my Samsung TV that's mounted at end of bed on the wall. My only complaint is that some channels are still too loud even on level 1 volume. Never had a speaker that could not get almost quiet. Volume level 1-5 all sound the same and much louder than expected in a quiet bedroom. But, that's only bad for me on certain channels or sources. Most want this loud and it does that very well.

Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don‚Äôt ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn‚Äôt JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be ‚ÄúStunning,‚Äù ‚ÄúPowerful,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSupercharged!(Pun intended.)‚Äù On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn‚Äôt the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I‚Äôm the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don‚Äôt have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn‚Äôt that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don‚Äôt have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven‚Äôt used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn‚Äôt expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV‚Äôs come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though‚Ä¶that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say ‚Äúreally,‚Äù I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don‚Äôt think that I can ever go back to what I had‚Ä¶PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I‚Äôll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I‚Äôll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you‚Äôll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,TRUE,81,Color: Black

Whether I‚Äôm chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let‚Äôs talk about the sound quality. It‚Äôs impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy ‚Äì it‚Äôs deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I‚Äôve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I‚Äôm not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I‚Äôve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it‚Äôs held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I‚Äôve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It‚Äôs a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôm happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you‚Äôre definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that‚Äôs worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you‚Äôre an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won‚Äôt disappoint.

While size and weight were both somewhat important, there was no requirement for it to fit into a cup holder or anything like that.I have been a live sound audiophile for decades and I have my own high end PA, play in a band, and do DJ'ing for select family and friends as a hobby with my equipment. I mention this just to let you know that I know good sound when I hear it.Ergonomics: The unit can be easily carried in one hand and it is very light. The unit sits firm when you set it down. The controls are both easy to use and obvious to find.Sound quality: This thing can fill a private pool area with music EASILY. The bass response indoors seems a bit much when you turn it up a little (seems OK at lower volume inside); but outside, it is EXACTLY what the doctor ordered. Outside, the Charge 5 sounds full, warm, and articulate. You can easily hear the various instruments in the mix. Personally, I wouldn't use a bluetooth speaker indoors .... or if I did, I would opt for one that was made for that specific purpose (higher quality codec, more balanced eq, etc). It is clear that the Charge 5 was made for going outside (IP67 rating, super long battery life, etc). It isn't a bad speaker for indoor listening (especially if you aren't an audiophile as I am and just want something to listen to while you do dishes/laundry/etc, etc). Listening indoors, I was pleased enough (although my PA has nothing to worry about ;). One would certainly hope that a 10K front of house PA would sound better than a $180 bluetooth speaker). With respect to output volume, this little speaker can get quite loud. Unless I was hosting a huge party (where I would use my real PA anyway), this speaker has more than enough output for anyone. To sum up the sound quality, it is very good indeed.Bluetooth connectivity: Simple and easy to connect to. I had no issues. The speaker appears to have a greater range than my house area! My wife left in her car, and even in her car, it continued to play until she got out of the driveway. Pretty impressive. More than enough range to cover an outdoor area, or an entire floor in your house (maybe even 2 floors ..... but why wouldn't you just carry it upstairs with you?).Features: Ok, one minor quibble that I have eluded to. The unit doesn't have an adjustable EQ as of the current firmware. I am really hoping that JBL gets on the ball and corrects this. This would be particularly useful for trimming the bass at higher volumes inside where the bass is a bit too much with the standard eq it comes with. Of course, most people will not play it that loud indoors, and some will love the emphasized bass response exactly as it is (perhaps not the audio purist :)). The rest of the features are very good and well thought out.For $180.00 USD, this speaker is as good as it gets.","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2021",AGHTFWTSFTGSPZXEPXVBDLHH73LA,TRUE,98,Color: Black

I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have.

They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,TRUE,22,Color: White

I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,TRUE,3,Color: Black

It uses a usb-c instead of a micro, which is nice because now everything I own uses the same charging cord. It has upper-middle sound quality, which is about the best you can get out of a portable Bluetooth speaker (it's just not possible to get really high-quality sound out of these types of speakers; this is as good as it gets). It is louder than anything this small has any right to be. There's nowhere in my 1600 sq ft house I can put this thing and not hear it everywhere else. It's great for backyard parties and setting it in a central location while you move all around the house.My only complaint is the battery life. I'm getting about 2.5 hours on it before the warning light starts blinking. That, to me, is pretty disappointing for a speaker that's more than $150 and meant to be portable. I basically have to use it as a wired speaker every other time I use it. Since I mainly use it in-house, that's not a deal breaker, but if you want to actually take it places, that could be a problem.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AGLO45QJWZQDTEXEQSGPRZQUM3YA,TRUE,18,Color: Camouflage

I like music when I‚Äôm working so sound quality is important to me. I‚Äôd say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks. Ps the jbl app to mess with EQ is lacking in customization and barely changes the sounds. Honest opinion I spent a lot of money in 24 hours and I choose the boom 2 this go around.

Having used Bose Sound Link and similar speakers over the years, I noticed this B&O A1 2nd generation on sale and decided to purchase it based on my previous experiences with B&O. For roughly $200 US dollars on sale, I decided to purchase this speaker because of it‚Äôs relatively small footprint, having Amazon Alexa built in, and the sound quality (60 watts total power) of B&O. The design and build quality are what you‚Äôd expect from B&O. Beautiful brushed aluminum and a nifty little hand loop for carrying, the large donut-shaped speaker lies flat, while dispersing 360 degree stereo sound.After charging the battery to full, I quickly added the speaker via my iPhone‚Äôs Bluetooth settings and then upgraded the speaker software via the B&O app. You can easily change the sound output of the speaker through the customizable EQ settings via the app. Amazon Alexa is easily setup (via the Alexa app) and works like it‚Äôs supposed to. There are 3 microphones on the speaker and they function well. Sound is clear and bright. Soundstage is fairly wide for this little speaker and the volume gets plenty loud for my needs.Overall, I would recommend this product as an amazing value to anyone who wants a little BT speaker from B&O. It is water and dust proof (IP67 rated) and easily fits into a backpack or travel bag. In terms of durability, time will tell, but this thing is built like a tank, and weighs just one pound. I have not had any Bluetooth connectivity issues and the battery is rated to last 18 hours after a full charge (3 hours charging time via included USB-C cable). Any changes to the aforementioned specs and I‚Äôll update this review. All in all, I‚Äôm happy with this purchase. If you like B&O, you can‚Äôt go wrong with a portable speaker at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGJ3UD45S2JMZJRBYSF4HA2FLJWA,TRUE,4,Color: Anthracite

I needed a speaker that was compact enough to fit in my carry-on without taking up too much space, but still delivered top-notch sound. My priorities were solid battery life (at least a few hours at full volume), lightweight design, good sound range, and most importantly, no tinny audio‚Äîsomething with decent bass.I‚Äôm happy to say this speaker met and exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is superb‚Äîdefinitely better than my older, bulkier Bose Soundlink II, and while it‚Äôs not quite on the level of the Sonos Move, the A1 more than makes up for it in portability and price. Both of those speakers are good, but just too big for travel. The 360-degree sound is perfect for dropping in the middle of a table or patio and having the music evenly spread around. No issues with volume or clarity‚Äîit carried beautifully.After the trip, I started using it at home too, and now it hangs in our master bathroom for when I‚Äôm getting ready in the morning. It looks great hanging on the wall and fills the room with rich sound.Overall, this speaker hits the sweet spot for everything I wanted‚Äîcompact size, excellent sound, and great value.

My work area is limited and in the middle of my kitchen / living / dining area ‚Äî so aesthetics are also a factor.I specifically wanted: (1) reliable, high quality audio for conferencing and music, (2) small footprint, (3) cable-free / wireless operation, and (4) long battery life.On paper, the B&O Beosound A1 seemed ideal; however after extensive research I felt like I would be paying a premium for the small form factor while compromising on sound quality (ref Alan Ross YouTube videos) and perhaps battery life. I decided to take the plunge as I could return the unit if it disappointed.The unit was delivered on time and I was very impressed with the packaging, instruction booklet, physical quality, and straightforward button layout. Setup and software update using the B&O iOS app was intuitive and almost effortless. Pairing the unit with my MacBook Pro and selecting the microphone and speaker in MacOS preferences was routine. The unit charged from 80% to 100% using my MacBook Pro USBC power adapter in about 2 hours. I immediately tested music playback and found it acceptable and inline with Alan Ross‚Äôs review (good highs and mids, less than robust bass, and sound quality highly sensitive to speaker placement / tweeter orientation). I also observed that the unit would power off after a period of inactivity and was concerned that I might have to reset the speaker and microphone connections after turning the unit back on. All in all these were potential complications I could live with.The unit passed its inaugural 1 hour Microsoft Teams meeting / video conference with flying colors the following day: powering it up reestablished wireless Bluetooth pairing, plus microphone and speaker assignments; and audio quality was reliable and exceptional throughout the meeting. This is the primary reason I purchased the unit, so I was ready to claim mission accomplished. However, a surprise was in store.After my conference call I decided to check battery level using the B&O app ‚Äî the unit was at 95% after a few hours of experimenting with music playback, letting the unit sit overnight and a 1 hour conference call in the morning. That was reassuring, but while in the app my attention was drawn to the app‚Äôs Equalizer feature which I had glossed over during setup and did not examine during my prior musical exploration -- so I decided decompress to random selections from my Apple Music library while also testing the equalizer settings.Wow, I was blown away by the difference in sound quality using the equalizer ‚Äî particularly the Ambient setting. I listened to selections from John Williams, Florence + the Machine, Acadia, Los Lonely Boys, Makaveli, Chick Corea, James Blake, Lydia Low, Ani DiFranco, Prince, Coldplay, Matisyahu, Public Enemy, Anthony and The Johnsons, Yael Naim and others. The range featured classical, R&B, rock, reggae, metal, alternative, singer songwriter, vocal, instrumental, a cappella ‚Äî an excellent sample of what I listen to ‚Äî and nothing disappointed: Sound clarity is excellent, highs are bright, mids are uniform and punchy, lows are deep and moving for a 5"" speaker, and volume is excellent for my use case (personal audio ‚Äî not throwing a party).Net-net: It turns out that the Beosound A1 2nd Gen was a no compromises purchase for my requirements. The form factor perfectly matches my minimal Mac setup, the conferencing functionality is great and the sound quality is exceptional for my musical tastes. This product is of the best purchases I‚Äôve made.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2020",AHPIX7L5UB644PBPAWIU5VMTR3LQ,TRUE,108,Color: Anthracite

There is low end to be had and i think it is in perfect balance in contrast to some other speakers that were so bass forward as to be a bit boomy.The speaker is also very aesthetically pleasing, lightweight and easy to take with you for traveling.Bluetooth connectivity was quick, easy and 100% hassle free whereas some of the other top models out there had trouble connecting or random disconnects or dropouts.my only complaint - if i absolutely had to make one - would be that it does not come with any type of carrying or travel case. A simple felt bag would have been nice just to protect it from scuffs or scratches, but i can probably find an old Crown bag or something to put it in.Buy this speaker - you WILL like it","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2024",AEC2L4L6EOG2OPWLALWQNGLO6DYQ,TRUE,13,Color: Anthracite

This is one of those times. I trusted Bang & Olufsen brand to not only sound great but to be high quality and for them to support their products. After purchasing 2 of these so I could have a ""stereo pair"", I shouldn't have purchase either.To be clear (pun intended), the speakers sound great! The Bluetooth connectivity to configure the stereo pair is clunky and has to be re-set every time you use them. Not the end of the world but not what I would expect from B&O. The issue I have is that one of the speakers FAILED 3 days outside the 30 day return window at Amazon. Again, NOT what I would expect from a premium B&O product. But I could almost live with this too.What I couldn't live with is that after 45 min on the phone wit Bang & Olufsen and their tech support determining that the speaker was faulty after 3 uses and owning it for 33 days, THEY NEED A FULL MONTH to do an inspection and determine whether or not the speaker should be replaced? Seriously? I've owned it for a month and your tech just said it is defective. Now I have to go back to send it back to you for another month to look at it? Not OK.Failures and quality issues happen. We understand that. But we'll be sticking with companies that stand behind their products in meaningful ways and don't put their customers in the middle of their manufacturing issues in the future.If you get a speaker that works, you'll like the sound. If you get one that fails, you're in for a long ride.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AGPLNWPFVK6COM2RFDE5AO3WBBUA,TRUE,13,Color: Anthracite

Beyond that most can be, and are corrected with a firmware update. Now that being said, my opinion of course here on this unit follows. I have only had this 2nd generation Beosound A1 for a day, so keep that in mind. But right out of the box, this is the best sounding truly portable speakers that I have ever heard, period. Amazingly so, in fact that I have ordered a two more to fit an application that required exactly what these A1's offer. Beautiful clean sound that is loud enough in a large hockey puck style footprint the can be placed under a kitchen cabinets trim, virtually out of sight. How awesome it that? I had zero connectivity issues, and as a matter of fact I was surprised how well the connectivity worked with my iPhone, iPad, and 12"" MacBook. Just as you would expect from a Bluetooth 5.1 device! I cannot and will not comment on Alexa connectivity because if I wanted Alexa capability I would just fire up one of the useless Alexa units that I have in my closet. I can only suspect B&O added Alexa capability because they have some licensing deal with Amazon. As for battery usage I have only had it for a day. But if it comes close to the 18 hours as listed this is even more a winner. And of course this is really portable so you can just plug it as you do your phone to fully charge in 2.75 hours. As for the microphones to be used as a conferencing type device....pretty cool. Though I have not tested them. It will be a bonus if they work as well as the rest of this device's features. You have to keep in mind that if you want Alexa, Siri, Google, and tele-conferencing capabilities you ALWAYS have to purchase dedicated devices for those needs.. If you can get a device like the B&O A1 (2ND GEN) that is ""primarily"" a portable battery operated speaker that you can bring to the beach to be just decent at those other things then you are way ahead of the game.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AE23O75IIZVYP34WJST2EBUB4KXA,TRUE,17,Color: Sport

THEIR speakers sound better and are louder than this one whether it's a JBL, Tribit, Sony, or Bose speaker. I'll pass by and their music drowns mine. So before I get to specifics, tl;dr, everything I'm about to say is just going to call back to this: just get something else for this price bracket because this speaker will disappoint you.Battery life? This thing will last you roughly 3 hours at max volume. How do I know that? My store closes 5 hours into my shift and I'm using it for the last 3 hours of my shift and by the time I clock out it either already died or is about to die. It also takes an eternity to charge to full. You basically need to leave it overnight for it to charge so if I ever forget to charge the thing 3 hours before my shift, it's not going to charge to full. I had a JBL Clip 4 I got for 60 bucks that lasted longer than this and charged better. Other nitpick about charging this thing is the fact that it turns on automatically when you connect a charger to it and you have to wait a little more than 5 seconds to be able to turn it off. It's annoying.Sound? It sounds fine when it's right next to you. The quality and bass is real nice. But if you step more than 10 feet away from it or if you're at a specific angle away from this speaker, the quality just dips drastically. Like I said, the main thing I really care about it is how loud it is and every other speaker in the $100 bracket around me just outclasses this thing. This thing is in the $200 bracket. I'll step a few feet away from my speaker and barely hear it, but I'll definitely hear my coworkers' speaker from the next aisle over.How does it look? I've seen a lot of reviews saying, ""Oh wow this thing has some kick to it for how small it is!"" This thing is not small. They're lying. Those reviews will make you think it's as no bigger than a teacup plate. No, this thing is surprisingly big and bulky. It will not fit in most hoodie pockets. You cannot clip it to anything because it is also heavy. This thing literally looks like and is the size of a smoke detector.Bluetooth connectivity? Yeah it's pretty good. Very annoying though when I plug it in to charge and it automatically turns on and thus connects to my phone and starts playing sound through it. Like seriously, why is this a feature?Anyways, yeah. Get something else. This thing is not worth it.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2023",AEFMXV3RMQLU2W7DDFI42K7MRBCA,TRUE,13,Color: Grey Mist

I am not disappointed at all, so good sound quality for a single portable unit that I bought another proudly as a gift to a physician (I wouldn't give substandard product to a doctor, would you)?I've only charged the battery once and it's lasted for now for about 3 weeks with about 1-2 hours use per day average. This may be a rough estimate, but kid you not, I don't have to recharge this unit every day or even every few days.The sound quality is superb. I have it setting on a piano top and get plenty of bass. I can hear the mid and high tones well for instruments, and vocals sound realistic, as if at a small venue concert. Now, I am wondering what the dual unit stereo arrangement would sound like!The mobile app is unique, I've never seen a circular dial display to adjust the treble/bass variably and with as fine variations for an audio device. It's almost as if you had a potentiometer at your fingertips but really via a screen display!

Bad Bluetooth leads to ruined experience",Colin M. Shawhan,2,"Does not sync reliably and often drops leading to a crackling stutter. Seems this high end brand is pushing a product aimed at a utilitarian application and failing.The trouble started immediately on charging and powering the speakers on. Setup is temperamental. Okay, no sweat. But once set up the units constantly dropped Bluetooth signal causing a popping sound, disrupting the media, and toggling in and out of stereo mode. Stereo pairing was barely functional.Thinking this might be battery related, I purchased a 3x1 USB charger to try the units in an external powered state, which was markedly better. But the signal loss persisted, if less frequently.I decided to perform further testing: the laptop.The B&O performs as poorly with the laptop (2022 HP i7) as the Android with Bluetooth connectivity dropping approx. once per minute at less that 3ft of distance. My wife's $20 bluetooth speaker connected flawlessly under the same conditions, same day and weather. She's not an audiophile, but her speaker works.This would be functionally useless in a social setting and an absolute disaster in a professional setting, like a PowerPoint, where technical problems can kill a presentation. No can do!I am a professional and I demand reliability.As for sound it's pretty clean, but I fail to hear 2x $250 worth of WOW! I opted for Jazz but I also tinkered with Metal and Hip Hop. For Jazz it performed well enough. I would not recommend these speakers to fans of Rock, Rap or Country. Perhaps Classical? The bass is anemic, which is unsurprising for a 4"" driver. I wasn't expecting night club bass. Maybe they want me to shell out another $700 for a sub. Would it sync? Forget it.These speakers do not connect successfully enough to be useful for audio reproduction of any kind, let alone deserving of ""audiophile"" status. Imagine a fancy sports car that won't run. What will your hot date think of your broken down Ferrari, waiting for a tow truck on the side of the expressway? Not much. It simply doesn't work.Give me a Ford F-150 that runs, which is why I might consider something like Bose. I would say that's a fair comparison. B&O have their place but it is not your family barbecue. Maybe Bose or JBL isn't the top of the audiophile line, but if it syncs and plays it is 1000x better than this mess.Avoid.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023",AEROHBBCRM7TESY3O5YRCC5WLP3A,TRUE,2,Color: Anthracite

For outdoor use I‚Äôve owned the Bose Soundlink (2, actually). It has decent sound for a small unit, although the batteries have tended to die prematurely.I looked for a new option and ran across this B&O unit. I knew the company had a good reputation for quality audio, but had never owned any of their gear. When I initially purchased the A1, I thought, this is okay, but not better than my Bose that cost half as much. Then I began tinkering with the streaming music from my iPad. Two things: 1) On an iPad/iPhone go to Settings>Music>EQ and hit Rock. That brings out the highs and lows of this speaker. 2) Also, I think several weeks of use ‚Äúloosened up‚Äù the speakers and allowed for an improved audio experience. I‚Äôm no audiophile, but it simply sounded better after some use.One tip: put the speaker about 1‚Äô from a wall for maximum bass.The bottom line is, the speaker sounds fantastic, even at lower volumes. It is well built and feels substantial in your hand. I absolutely love it. In all fairness to Bose, I‚Äôve not heard the Revolve II. It is far larger than the B&O, but is not nearly a sexy or portable.Spend the money.

You can set it next to you at a lower volume, pump up the bass to a level you want through the companion app and get a full sound, all the while the person on the other end of the couch can barely hear it. Or you can turn it up for others to hear. I added a personal EQ setting that upped the bass so at lower volumes I could have a more full sound. From there as I increase the volume, I move to the ‚ÄúAmbient‚Äù setting and I guess if I cranked it loud enough I would move on to the ‚ÄúOptimal‚Äù setting. I think it just depends on how much bass you want.I ordered a second one to test the stereo sound on this. I‚Äôve read some people had issues with this, so it might not work out. I‚Äôll update this with my findings.Update 1: I found pairing 2 beoplay A1‚Äôs into stereo mode is easy. I had no issues with it. It does not sound any louder in stereo but it sounds good. You can also choose to set them up in mono mode and they sound much louder this way.Update 2: In the end I returned both speakers, I thought they sounded excellent but for $500.00 I could get more sound for less. I ended up with the UE Hyperboom. It‚Äôs stereo or mono, it sounds extremely good turned down low and excellent turned up from medium to high.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2021",AELTNTCH226APEWUWWQE34OFKKEA,TRUE,6,Color: Anthracite

No treble screech when pushed‚Ä¶in fact, very little notable distortion when cranking it up with TI or Electric Six. A very enjoyable sound that can be listened to without ear fatigue.BUT‚Ä¶..it has one very annoying habit. When plugged in to charge, it immediately turns itself on and then connects to any active Bluetooth connection it can locate, many times disconnecting what‚Äôs already connected. No other wireless speaker I‚Äôve used does this, incl Bose, JBL, Oonz, UE, etc. Darned annoying when I‚Äôm on my headphones and plug in the B&O to charge only to have it start blasting what was previously thru the cans.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2022",AFTQWWPTSWM4SZ3JHPKSF3HGUQDA,TRUE,40,Color: Sport

I have two complaints, though: the Bluetooth interface is terrible. If, for example, you have the BT connection set to ""calls and audio"", Everytime you get an sms, the sound feed goes into pause mode. The speaker auto-connects to it's last paired device so, for example, if you have both a cell phone and a tablet that you use with the B&O device, you literally need to turn BT off on one (the previous) device to avoid the B&O device from doggedly trying to reconnect with the former device that it was paired with while you're in setup mode. Also, the Gen 2 A1 frequently loses it's Bluetooth connection which puts whatever you're using to stream into pause mode. Then you have to click on the app to continue when the A1 reconnects.I'm also not overly-enamored with the sound quality. It is good, but not great. And this BT-only speaker has a ""it has to sound great"" price tag. My biggest issue, though, is that B&O got rid of the feature that allowed the previous generation to connect via either wifi or BT. I really miss the ability to just connect it with wifi -- and I'm pretty sure the sound quality would be a lot better.These are not huge issues, but when we're talking about equipment from a high-end company like B&O, I expect complete transparency and perfect functionality. And this misses that mark from various standpoints.","Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2021",AF5LR7NND6IRO7NTDBUTZNKUG2HA,TRUE,4,Color: Grey Mist

I'm an electrician and am usually working in open framed houses. I'll place the speaker in a center of a room and listen to it as a I work. I find that the speaker volume has to be on medium-high for me to use that way. Which means I end up having to charge the speaker every day after work to have it ready for the next day.The speaker is more situated in single room environments.

The bass response of the B&O A1 Second generation blew me away. In fact, the bass was too loud in some music.Only disappointment was that there is no tone control (only volume control) on the speaker itself. For this, you need to use the BeoPlay App which I found difficult to navigate.The Instruction Manual provided with the B&O A1 was a completely uninformative waste of paper.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AHC6VSELJU4AQGN2NPKBNTPVINKA,TRUE,5,Color: Anthracite

The only problem I had is one of the speaker's Bluetooth module failed within a month of purchase. The support from B&O was practically non-existent, which is pretty disappointing. Fortunately, it was purchased through Amazon so I was able to get a replacement right away. The replacement is alive and well so let's see how long they last. My old BeoLab 4 PC are still kicking from over 10 years ago. The sound quality of these speakers are comparable but in a smaller form factor and have the ability to stream via Bluetooth as well as via Multiroom on the B&O app. Overall, I am happy with the purchase but slightly disappointed with the longevity of the electronics in these newer Made in China B&O's.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2020",AHLV66DQX4ZBZAYV5Y3MSG2UDBSQ,TRUE,13,Color: Anthracite

I do have some songs that it just doesn't handle all that well though. Battery life is amazing. I use it at work for about 6.5 hours (at about 40% volume), then about an 1.5 hours more at home (at about 30% volume), and only need to recharge it once a week. Yes, turning up the volume will require more power. But, if you just like adding ambiance, keeping it below half volume gives great endurance.Bluetooth delay greatly depends on the app being used. For most video streaming purposes, the lag was minimal to where it wasn't a distraction. Games were a few seconds behind which makes this not a good experience.Using the speaker for phone calls worked well.Since I use it daily, it has quite a few dings. At work, I tie it around my belt so it does get hit once in a while. The scuffs really do show, and not gracefully contrary to the advertising.Price may be a pain point for some buyers.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020",AHWHHUFODHW3F62NH5CC4SNVNVZQ,TRUE,21,Color: Grey Mist

Im talking, 3 hours at modest volume at most. I've never seen battery degradation like this, despite making sure I followed typical protocols for battery life during this time. It may have also been sub par to begin with in terms of battery life, but I find myself blown away with how quickly it dies nowadays.The app is horrible, and the Bluetooth connectivity is always a chore. Sometimes I will take me 15 min of switching the speaker on and off, Bluetooth on and off on the device, forgetting the device, re pairing, etc until I get it to work... Which always seems to be random. And it's not just my phone - my wife and kids phones have the same issue, whether using the B&O app or not. Ive never had a Bluetooth device act so poorly in my life. This alone is not worth the hassle.Build quality is great. Solidly built. Sounds decent but not exceptional for the price. I don't often review, but am surprised this has so many positive reviews, to be honest.

When we first received the B&O speaker my family sat around in awe at how something roughly 5"" in diameter could fill a room with such amazing sound. It is expensive, no doubt, but as one reviewer said before me this is simply the best sounding speaker in it's class. We went with the Grey Mist color that not only accentuates the design but makes the controls on the side very easy to see and operate, which I know was a criticism from others who ordered the darker color.

The microphone quality is awful - grainy, far-away, and distant, and I've gotten complaints from every person I've tried to call on this thing. Furthermore, it has a ""speakerphone mode"" which degrades both input and output quality of the device, and you can't switch it off if you're using the microphone, ie. you can't use this speaker to play high-quality audio while you use a different microphone.The audio quality is good but pairing it with the MacBook Pro which has no system-level equaliser out the box and no B&O app, it's annoyingly bassy when I don't want it to be. It shuts off automatically after a period of time which means I have to re-pair it with my MacBook every now and again if I'm not listening to something continuously, and the Bluetooth pairing isn't alway successful.Overall, nice music-playing speaker.

He immediately ordered two more Emberton II‚Äôs so we could both enjoy the stacking feature.The only disappointment is that it doesn‚Äôt stack in stereo. So you don‚Äôt get that speaker interplay from stereo recordings.To stack, only connect one of the two speakers via bluetooth to your device. Then follow the instructions for button pressing to stack the second one, without connecting it to the same device via bluetooth. The speakers connect to each other independently.

When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment. Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement. With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed. 80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing. This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later). I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting. Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music. I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat. It was a different performance altogether. I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application. Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install. The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later. The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder. Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top. Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently). If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat. Single speaker, stereo sound. Let that sink in.Done? Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point). Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat. This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you. that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2022",AEFUDKDNGZTOEP2BCFB4CLUELCYQ,TRUE,174,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn‚Äôt need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine‚Äôish considering the size of speaker. It‚Äôs fine for background music if you‚Äôre flexible on sound quality as long as you don‚Äôt play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone‚Äôs speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less. The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I‚Äôm at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine. But what is the point of the app? I interpreted from the manual that I should download the app to get extra features. Maybe bass and treble controls? The book claims you can stack more speakers through the app but I would not invest in that as it continually says my phones Bluetooth is off. lolFine retro look, sturdy, small footprint and working out for podcasts. Do not think the app is or will be helpful.If I were to try another I‚Äôd probably go with the Klipsch of similar design. It‚Äôs approximately $50 more but better sound and working app.Remove $25 dollars off price on the Em II and it‚Äôs a fair deal.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2024",AHIQF7PWHKOE36B564CMAEITLRDQ,TRUE,14,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

The battery lasting up to 30 hours is impressive, though I didn't just it more than a few hours and couldn't speak to what real-time is. The top metal multi-directional button is very nice and premium feel......however the textured top/rubber surround makes reading the Volume/Track directions virtually impossible to see - you get used to it, but it would be nice if they were a little more visible.I will say that I'm disappointed in 2024, we're still seeing devices with Bluetooth 5.1, considering that it was released in 2016 and 5.3 has been out since 2021.With the driver's front and back-firing, I found that I got a wider sound by turning the unit sideways so that I was looking at the side of the unit while the drivers fired left and right.I listen to just about anything, and other were songs where the speaker excelled, but then others where it sounded very flat, and it's because of the inconsistency that I returned it. I will say that I liked it much more than the JBL's that I tested against which had almost zero depth comparatively, but for a little more I got something that, while larger, has a better sound presence.I was tempted to keep this as an alternative, but I think over time I would probably get annoyed with some songs sounding flat and others very deep and rich (or course tracks and recording quality matter, but compared to other speakers I tested I didn't see as big of a swing between the same songs).","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AEZLB3QWTROAPNV3SIQVKNOFDS3Q,TRUE,4,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,TRUE,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

I may have more to add once I've had it for a while, but as of this moment I'm genuinely impressed. I will be buying at least one for a present for a sibling.

Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music.

Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,TRUE,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

As wanted, I pair them together to get surround sound, smaller size, and save about $50. Although I own two pairs of Marshall headphones which I'm taking with me to Heaven, at that time - it took awhile for me to commit to buying the speakers. That's because I already own a pair of off-brand Bluetooth speakers that sound so much better and lasts many hours longer than more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, etc. They have all the other bells-and-whistles specifications, including USB-C, rapid charging, 20+ hours playtime and only cost $30 each. The seller stopped selling them on Amazon.Emberton II was a huge jump in price. The difference from Emberton I - is it will pair with other Marshall speakers. But only the latest models like the Middleton or more Emberton IIs. Also, the Emberton II has a grain texture finish. The hardest part about buying Marshall products is knowing if you actually got authentic products. Knock-offs provide knock-off quality and it hurts the reputation of genuine products with bad reviews. I won't describe the differences in great details. The box is printed on all sides that spills over to other sides. It looks and feels real money, very expensively printed. Inside packaging and booklets too. The speaker is very well crafted down to the smallest details and feels solid. The grills are finished very well, individually, without any rough edges or mistakes and so is the Marshall signature emblem. Look closely.The Emberton II sound quality is phenomenal for all music genres. It's a work of art pumping out sound, spatially separating all the tracks of instruments and voices, to hear them together in one song. This is studio quality at a reasonable price. It exceeds my $30 pair, which already beat-out all the other more expensive speakers, in the only way it could. I heard sounds playing in music I've heard so many times, I can replay it verbatim in my head. Some folks might scoff at this price point comparison. But if I'm completely satisfied at $30 or $170 - no one can entice me to spend $1500 or $15,000 I can afford to pay too. I might purchase more Emberton II's to install wireless speakers throughout the house. For now, I'm pretty satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2023",AFG3MMBXL5ODHUR3EXHWYGOHLNXA,TRUE,22,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

These days, bluetooth speakers can get pretty big, so these are not tiny, but fairly small, and would easily fit in a backpack (although they would fit, I wouldn't carry them around in a backpack because the passive radiators are not protected in any way) For their size the are weighty the feel very solid in your hand. There is an app to help with firmware upgrades and tweaking the sound via an equalizer as well as customizing how the lights behave. I bought 2 of these because the have a stereo pairing function (which I love - and it's a halo feature that elevates the whole listening experience) it seems every company does the stereo pairing function a little differently but LG, like most Sony bluetooth speakers that support stereo pairing and Bose don't require an app to create a stereo pair and I think this is great because it means you can use the stereo pairing function with bluetooth players that aren't phone's like Computers, Dedicated Audio players and even some TV's (LG and most Sony's that support the function have a dedicated button that you use to create a stereo pair, Bose officially says their speaker require an app but Bose tech support told me how to create a stereo pair without using their app - which is kind cool) These speaker, once linked in a stereo pair stay linked until powered off, even if you end the bluetooth connection with your music source, Bose speakers only stay linked as long as they are connected to their music source - but Sony's remember that they are paired even after they are powered and when paired the Sony SRS-XBxx line can be fully controlled by either speaker in the pair - This isn't really true for the Bose implementation of stereo pairing. For the most part these LG XBoom speaker function as a single unit when paired so you can, for instance, raise and lower the volume of the pair from either speaker as well as skip forward and backward, play and pause and toggle ""Sound Boost"". as a bluetooth speaker these are very solid, they sound good, seem well built have some fun features and when you factor in the price they are one of the best values on the market right now. I'd buy them again for sure.","Reviewed in the United States August 12, 2021",AGVF5MKNCYCXLQNK7ST7F27DO7XA,TRUE,13,Style: XBOOM GO PL7 (Black)

Slightly less than mediocre.,Terry Rich,3,"Let me begin by saying that I am not an audiophile but I do listen to alot of music and appreciate good quality rich sound. I do not buy many bluetooth speakers and had to replace a failed one that I have had for years from a company that is no longer around called Bohm. I was heartbroken since my device failed after just a few years but the sound quality was very good. In researching new BT speakers I spent hours and hours watching Youtube vid's and reading reviews on top 5 and top 10. LG was never or seldom in any of those reviews. I didn't care if it was waterproof or even if I could pair it with several other like units. I use it in my garage while I am doing my DIY projects. I knew the price range I wanted to be in so it did not have to be a blaster for a Trance party. After spending so much time on line reviews I simply could not take any more and needed to pull the trigger. I did learn alot about listening ranges that humans could hear and not hear but feel. Turns out that thump that you feel from a big subwoofer is felt but not heard at a low end hz range of 4-16hz and then the human ear begins to hear at 20hz and goes to about 20khz for the top end. Many mfgr's did not clearly publish their ranges but markets lights and big sound but I am a technical guy and don't care for marketing much. I like to be pleasantly surprised and not disappointed. I eventually settled on a name like LG since we are all familiar with the name and quality of products such as TV's, cell phones, washers and dryers thinking they have it all covered with there PL7 series BT speaker with sound from Meridian in the UK. Turns out not! The format is fine in the PL7. It pairs super easily, buttons have a good tactile feel and press solidly. The passive woofers on each end with adjustible lights are even fine. It is heavy enough to be a good if not great speaker but in my opinion is not. I don't know much about crossover hardware or things like and upon opening the box I felt confident that I got much more than I expected. However upon setting it up I soon found out it was just slightly less than mediocre, the sound. The base is non existent and upon going into the downloaded app. The low end (bass) on the equalizer starts at 90hz?? Not 60hz or 40hz but 90hz. I turned up the bass as high as it would go on the custom equalizer in the app and nothing. 90hz is truly mid-range and not base. Then on the custom equalizer the top end frequency tops out at 10khz? So the high end is weak as well. This leaves only the mid-range and that is not enough to make up for the missing low end frequency nor the high end. So truly the sound is not multi directional which may be OK if the sound was good but it is not. It is muddled, flat and horribly disappointing. It is not an expensive speaker at $107 but I expected much much more from LG and Meridian. I got marketing and pretty colors.I waited several days to write this since I wanted to be fair and give it several chances but today was it for me. I have to say something about this. It is a mediocre speaker and I am sure there are far better speakers out there, lots of them, in the price range or slightly higher. I trusted LG based on their other products. 90hz-10khz, really? No thump, barely any base at all as you can imagine, blurry top end. If you were listening to a high hat symbol you would never hear it. I have my doubts about keeping it and it is not about the money. My time is very valuable and I do not want to go back into the research process again but I still may. Everything is cool about this speaker except for the sound reproduction. Actually the app is very weak too. Only 1 template for the equalizer and that is Standard. Even my TV has preprogrammed equalizers for classical, rock, hip hop, etc. This has 1 and then Custom and 5 slide bars to maximize your sound which as I stated starts at 90hz and goes to 10khz. Not nearly enough range and tweaking them truly does not improve the sound much if any.I am sorry that I have to write this but this is how we all learn.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2022",AG73LQVX3AZV2Q233RCNKSII5APA,TRUE,17,Style: XBOOM GO PL7 (Black)

It felt sturdy and durable, making it a great choice for outdoor activities or just to carry around in general. The LED lighting feature is also a nice touch, adding a fun and energetic vibe to any environment.However, I was a bit disappointed with the sound quality. While the bass was decent, the mids and highs were not up to par. The sound felt lacking and lacked clarity, making it difficult to fully enjoy my music. It's a shame, as the speaker has such a great design and features, but the sound quality leaves something to be desired.In conclusion, if you're looking for a speaker with good built quality and decent bass, the LG XBOOM Go Portable Bluetooth Speaker might be a good option. However, if sound quality is a top priority for you, I would recommend looking into other options as the mids and highs are not as good as one might expect.","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2023",AHCLN2GBPQBWA2UFRCHD2MPBKK6A,TRUE,0,Style: XBOOM GO PL7 (Black)

PART 2,Rick,1,"I loved this speaker! For about 4 months until the sound quality became very staticky. I called LG and they almost gave me a refund, but the rep asked me if I paid tax on the order. I said of course I did. Because the $6 tax took the item over $100, they said that they could not issue me a refund and that I would have to send the defective unit to their repair center to troubleshoot. If found to be defective, they would either send me a new unit or repair the old. After waiting a week for the return shipping label, I tried calling LG again, got several disconnects and then their automated call back service called me 5 times but wouldn't connect when I answered. I called them one more time and finally got connected to another rep and she finally sent me a return shipping label. I asked to speak with a supervisor to inform them of their poor customer service. She put me on hold for over 40 minutes, before saying a supervisor was not available and that she would call me back when available. Still no callback.My friend also bought the same speaker and his works fine. So, in summary if you choose this speaker, cross your fingers that you get a good one. Otherwise, good luck dealing with LG (Life is Not Good) to fix it.As a Postscript - I returned this item to the LG Repair Center and received it back. It's still defective! I called LG and they said the best they can do is to have me return the unit again to their repair center. This is by far the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever experienced. No replacement unit. No refund. How many times am I going to have to return the unit for repair.Not sure if I'll waste my time doing this. Next step may be for me to call Amazon or my credit card company for a refund.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AGSGT3CV7Z6KYARFIPGSFKYEXJMQ,TRUE,4,Style: XBOOM GO PL7 (Black)
